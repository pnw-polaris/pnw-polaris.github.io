      <description>This year I’ll celebrate eleven years at Microsoft. In September of 1996 I maxed out a credit card to relocate from Estevan, Saskatchewan to Redmond, Washington joining up with Microsoft as a contractor. As a contractor I didn’t qualify for relocation benefits, but I figured it was a worthy risk :-). My first job was to support the beta of Active Server Pages along with Internet Studio. Later on I made the transition to full-time employee status, supporting the released editions of these new Internet products.</description>

Betsy’s recent post “What makes it a community” made me think about my own experiences running communities and the approach that I like to take.
Community has been part of my life for the past 20 years. My first experience was with a homebrew Bulletin Board called The Nutwork that ran on my Commodore 64 out my parent’s basement. This board ran faithfully on my Commodore 64 and eventually ended up running on my Amiga.</description>
