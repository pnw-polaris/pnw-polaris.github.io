    <p>Josie, Lauri and I went to the <a class="link" href="http://www.farmaid.org/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >Farm Aid</a> Concert in at the <a class="link" href="http://whiteriverconcerts.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >White River Ampitheater</a> last night. This was Josie‚Äôs first major concert. This is the 19th Farm Aid Concert. I‚Äôve watched them on television ever since I can remember. think Lauri and I started donating to Farm Aid shortly after we moved to the United States from Canada. My grandfather farmed and I have great memories being out on the farm with him during harvest. I think it was Neil Young last night that said, ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt you rather get your food from a farmer that feeds the same food to his family?‚Äù</p>
<p><img style="WIDTH: 360px; HEIGHT: 480px" alt="Guest Pass" hspace="2" src="http://www.jeffsandquist.com/images/posts/CIMG0780_20_28Small_29.JPG" align="right" vspace="2" border="1" /> Our seats were great, right down front and center with a great view of the stage. We had a cool surprise shortly after finding our seats. While getting Josie comfortable with ear plugs and her <a class="link" href="http://www.pollypockets.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >Polly Pockets</a>¬†a person from the Farm Aid organization popped over to say hi and ask us how we like our seats.</p>
<p>She produced lanyards with a laminated guest of Farm Aid card on them. We thanked her, but weren‚Äôt exactly sure what they were for. The girl told us that these would give us full access backstage where we‚Äôd find food, other families and of course kids for Josie to play with. We thanked her and continued to watch the warm up bands play.</p>
<p>The backstage passes were cool, but to be honest I‚Äôve been backstage at a couple of events before and always felt out of place. I wasn‚Äôt sure if we‚Äôd use them or not. This was a nice treat though from the Farm Aid folks.</p>
<p>A little bit later the Farm Aid girl returned (I feel awful I can‚Äôt remember her name) with a Dad and a little girl Josie‚Äôs age and said, ‚ÄúJosie! This little girl who‚Äôd like to meet you‚Äù. The girl was named Rowen and her Dad was Shawn. Turns out Rowen‚Äôs mom is Wendy. Wendy is a director of Farm Aid along with Sky someone who I‚Äôve communicated over email with for some time. Rowen asked if Josie if she wanted to pack up her Polly‚Äôs and maybe do some coloring backstage. So we decided to take them up on their offer and we were escorted backstage.</p>
<p>Baskstage was very cool and quite different than my previous experiences. There were families members of the artists, Farm Aid staff and volunteers. Everyone was watching the concert, eating fresh, family farm grown food Salmon, Brisket and Vegetables. Artists were playing XBox games and everyone was having a great time. It was awesome! Josie and Rowen dumped out a bag of Polly Pockets on the table and played with them and also colored.</p>
<p>Lauri and I had got some food from the buffet and got to know Shawn a lot better and Wendy popped over to say hi. Wendy and Shawn are from Boston where Farm Aid‚Äôs headquarters is located. The girls played for awhile and we enjoyed food and great conversation.</p>
<p>Later I was able to check out the infrastructure that they were using to drive the Farm Aid Streamcast for the event, it was all streamed in Windows Media 9. The website infrastructure is using software called <a class="link" href="http://www.convio.com/site/PageServer?pagename=support&amp;JServSessionIdr005=go2th7ffw1.app1a"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >Convio</a>¬†created during the Dean Campaign and now being adopted by a number of non-profits including Farm Aid.</p>
<p>After eating our food, the girls were ready to get back to the concert and dance. Rowen and Shawn joined us at our seats just as Steve Earle got on stage. Josie and Rowen rocked out to <a class="link" href="http://www.lyricsdomain.com/19/steve_earle/copperhead_road.html"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >Copperhead Road</a>¬†and continued there dance tribute to Farm Aid for a number of sets. While Jerry Lee Lewis¬†was playing Lauri stayed and watched his performance and I took Josie and Rowen backstage for cake.</p>
<p>Jerry Lee Lewis blew us away, what amazing energy, I hope I have that kind of energy in 10 years let alone 40 years from now. He rocked the house.</p>
<p>Josie and I got back to our seats (Rowen stayed with her mom and Dad backstage) and we were just in time for Dave Matthews‚Äô performance which was over the top. I‚Äôve never seen Dave play live before. The cool thing about the Farm Aid event was all performances seemed to be in the MTV Unplugged style. Accoustically instruments, not too loud so you could really hear the artist sing.</p>
<p>John Mellancamp came on stage and was great too, the crowd went nuts when he broke into Rain on the scarecrow.</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p>
    Rain on the scarecrow, Blood on the plow<br />This land fed a nation, this land made me proud<br />And Son I&#8217;m just sorry theres&#8217; no legacy for you now<br />Rain on the scarecrow, blood on the plow<br />Rain on the scarecrow, blood on the plow
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><img style="WIDTH: 640px; HEIGHT: 480px" alt="Josie and Rowen" hspace="2" src="http://www.jeffsandquist.com/images/posts/CIMG0786_20_28Small_29.JPG" align="left" vspace="2" border="1" /> The line in this song that gives me chills and brings a tear to my eye¬†is, ‚ÄúWell theres 97 crosses planted in the courthouse yard 97 families who lost 97 farms‚Äù.</p>
<p>One thing about John‚Äôs performance was his smoking. He seemed to start a new cigarette every time he did a new song. Didn‚Äôt he have heart surgery back a few years ago?</p>
<p>Neil Young then came on stage and Josie drifted off to sleep on my lap to <a class="link" href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/neilyoung/pocahontas.html"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >Pochantis</a>. In between each song he reminded folks about Family Farms. ‚ÄúDid you know that when Farm Aid started we were losing a thousand family farms a week. Now the number is down to 390, which means we‚Äôre failing‚Äù. Sad, 390 families a week no longer bring us food that they also eat to your table.</p>
<p>Willie Nelson finished off the evening with a medley of songs. He played old favorites, some blues pieces. Amazing performance.</p>
<p>With the evening complete Josie was sacked out in my lap. I carried her to the car and Lauri hauled along the Polly bags and other toys we brought along. We made the trek home, getting back to the house around midnight.</p>
<p>I can just imagine though that this has probably set Josie‚Äôs expectations for concerts a bit too high for the future. I am pretty sure that next concert we go to Josie won‚Äôt be eating catered food and playing Pollies backstage. üôÇ</p>
<p>What an amazing experience. Thank you Sky, Wendy, Shawn and Rowen for your hospitality. What an amazing event. Thank you Farm Aid.</p>
<p>If the Farm Aid event is in your area next year don‚Äôt miss it and more importantly if you care about Family Farming in America, please visit the Farm Aid site to learn more and <a class="link" href="http://www.farmaid.org/site/PageServer?pagename=support_donate"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >make a donation today</a>. When buying food, try and do it at a Farmers Market like <a class="link" href="http://www.pikeplacemarket.org/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >Pike Place</a> in Seattle.</p>
<p>Cheers! üôÇ</p>
