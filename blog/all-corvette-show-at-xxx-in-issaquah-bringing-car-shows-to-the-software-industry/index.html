    <p>Well, although I was invited this year to it I missed <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo_Camp"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >Foo Camp</a>.¬† Too bad.¬† Turns out even our new Chief Software Architect Ray Ozzie <a class="link" href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2006/08/foo-camp-2006.html"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >was able to make time</a> to go the event.¬† So my excuse of ‚Äúthe week getting away from me‚Äù really does not hold water.¬† Heck, if Ray can make it, how can I be too busy?¬† To be honest, it was an amazing week.¬† It was the first week since India and some vacation time where I really got back into the flow of things at work and man, what a great week.¬† We‚Äôre doing so many amazing things around <a class="link" href="http://channel9.msdn.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >Channel 9</a> and <a class="link" href="http://on10.net/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >10</a> right now it is really easy to get caught up in things.¬†¬† I am glad in a way that I missed the weekend as it allowed me to attend my first all Corvette show at the <a class="link" href="http://issaquahhistory.org/sites/xxxdrivein.htm"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >XXX Drive-Inn</a>¬†at Issaquah, Washington.¬† Well, attend as an owner that is.¬† üôÇ</p>
<p>To be honest I didn‚Äôt plan to show off my car, I was just planning to go and check out some of the cars, see some aftermarket products and call it a day.¬† As I drove by though the friendly folks at the entry waved me in and I donated $15.00 to the local charity and parked my car amongst the other C5s.¬† Heck, I might not show my car but the parking is great!¬†</p>
<p>It was instant community though.¬† Folks immediately popped over to say Hi who had similar cars as mine.¬† We talked about my car, theirs and they asked about my stereo (more on that later) and we got to know one another.¬† It was great.¬† Wonderful people, instant family.¬† Man, I learnt a lot about my car and some history items that I didn‚Äôt know already.¬† The entire <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Corvette"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >history of the Corvette</a>¬†was represented with over 200 cars in attendance.¬† I was able to grab a¬†lot of photos¬†and uploaded them to <a class="link" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffsand/sets/72157594253952538/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >my Flickr site</a>.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve actually started the process doing some minor modifications to my Corvette.¬† üôÇ (You can jump in chorus with my Wife to say, ‚ÄúBut didn‚Äôt you <a class="link" href="http://www.jeffsandquist.com/WhenYouHaveABadDayMakeItYourOwn.aspx"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >just get it</a>?‚Äù).¬† Well, the first logical step is to upgrade the audio system.¬†¬† The stock systems (made by Bose) in the Vettes really aren‚Äôt that great.¬† Ok they suck.¬† In fact a common phrase is, ‚ÄúNo highs, no lows, it must be Bose!‚Äù¬† I went down to Car Toys in Issaquah and spec‚Äôd out a pretty decent system.¬†¬† This is actually something I was really into in high school, entering sound-offs and audio competitions with an <a class="link" href="http://www.alpine-usa.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >Alpine</a> installation that I had in my car.¬† For all of my systems in the past I went Alpine all the way (subs, amplifiers and head units).¬† With the Corvette I ended mixing it up a bit.¬† The world really has changed in the audio world and boy are there choices.</p>
<p>For the head unit I purchased an <a class="link" href="http://www.alpine-usa.com/en/products/product.php?model=CDA-9857"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >Alpine 9857</a> with XM Radio and iPod support.¬† The iPod support is interesting in that you can control the iPod completely via the head unit.¬† I also like the fact that it supports data CDs and WMA|MP3 which allows you to pack together music on compilation CDs.¬† (I don‚Äôt own an iPod right now. :-)) For front speakers I went with <a class="link" href="http://www.focal-america.com/Products/Largeimages/Large_Images/165K2P_large.jpg"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >Focal 165 K2P</a>¬†and in the back I left the stock speakers alone (might need to upgrade these later).¬† We put a <a class="link" href="http://www.pioneerelectronics.com/pna/v3/pg/product/details/0,,2076_310069929_235349891,00.html"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >10‚Ä≥ Pioneer subwoofer</a> in the rear compartment <a class="link" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffsand/225745298/in/set-72157594215069270/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >in a custom made box.</a>¬† All of this is driven by a <a class="link" href="http://mobile.jlaudio.com/products_amps.php?amp_id=254"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >JL 300/4 amplifier</a>.</p>
<p>I was pretty nervous to let my car go into <a class="link" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffsand/225745383/in/set-72157594215069270/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >day surgery</a>, but the folks at <a class="link" href="http://www.cartoys.com/cartoy/webpages/popup_store.cfm?storecode=IQ"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >Car Toys in Issaquah</a> were top notch.¬† Here are a couple of photos to show the quality install.</p>

<p>Subwoofer box (rotated forward to show speaker and the connection)</p>
<p>So what does it sound like?¬† Awesome.¬† Crazy Awesome.¬† If you work at Microsoft and want to listen, just drop me a line. üôÇ</p>
<p>I think I spent about the same that I did when I was in high school for the overall system and it absolutely blows away anything I‚Äôve ever had before.¬† There are highs, lows and a really decent mid-range.¬† Lots and lots of bass.¬† (Can you ever have enough bass?)¬† You can get one hell of a back massage with the right choice of music and in with some songs (mostly dance stuff) it will actually lift your hair up.</p>
<p>So I am very happy with the whole thing, very happy in fact.¬†</p>
<p>So all of this and my experience at the car show got me to thinking about the software industry.¬† Why aren‚Äôt we creating more opportunities for people to show off their software?¬† Sure, we have Chris Shipley‚Äôs <a class="link" href="http://www.demo.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >demo conference</a>¬†that most will never get to enter or even attend. <a class="link" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mswanson"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >Mike Swanson</a> had some luck creating <a class="link" href="http://channel9.msdn.com/tags/ShowOff"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >Show Off</a> at PDC but what about every day?¬†¬† How can we share ideas the experiences we‚Äôre building with one another?¬†¬† I know there is Source Forge and Code Plex now on MSDN, but what if you don‚Äôt want to share the complete source?¬†</p>
<p>There is nothing out there for folks day to day to show cool experiences that they are building in the software business.¬† We need to create something similar to the car show I went to in Issaquah.</p>
<p>So what is it?¬†</p>
<p>I‚Äôm willing to throw Channel 9 into the equation.¬†¬†</p>
<p>Is it user videos?¬†<br>
Is it some sort of aggregate of the <a class="link" href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=31"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >Channel 9 Sandbox</a>, Flickr and YouTube?¬†</p>
<p>We need folks in the software business willing to share dreams and show off what they are doing with software.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think.¬†</p>
