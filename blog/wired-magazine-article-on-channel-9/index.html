    <p>It was last fall that <a class="link" href="http://www.thelongtail.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >Chris Anderson</a>¬†invited me over to Wired Magazine for lunch ‚ÄúCond√© Nast Style‚Äù (they have a private chef) and it was all pretty cool.¬† Chris gave me a personal tour of the facilities and told me all sorts of stories behind the history of Wired Magazine.¬† I would be lying if I didn‚Äôt say that this was a bit of a thrill for me.¬†¬†¬† In the tour I saw where Apache Server was coded, a wall crowned with every cover of the magazine and a view of their future through the new <a class="link" href="http://www.reddit.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >www.Reddit.com</a><font color=#000000> headquarters with lots of room for expansion.¬†¬† Lunch was great.¬† I sat with Chris and a number of senior folks from his team.¬† Our conversation focused on the work we‚Äôre doing at Microsoft around blogs, Channel 9 and community.¬† Chris was very interested in all the details and what originally was intended to be a short lunch stretched out into the afternoon.¬† We exchanged plenty of stories with Chris‚Äôs team taking plenty of notes.¬† One fun part of the lunch was a quote by Chris.¬† I was explaining how at Microsoft we refer to our employee guidelines for blogging as ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be stupid‚Äù.¬† The idea being that we believe we have very smart employees and trust that they know the smart thing to do on their blog.¬† Chris jumped in with, ‚Äúwow, that is smart and a heck of a lot better of guidelines than ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be evil‚Äù. üôÇ (I need to remember that).¬† Lunch ended with Chris assigning Fred Vogelstein to ‚Äúwrite the story of Microsoft and transparency.‚Äù¬†¬† <p class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt">Over the years I have spent a lot of time with press, bloggers, analysts and even other companies telling the story of Channel 9, transparency at Microsoft and how it all started.¬† It is with great honor and pride that I am able to share the amazing work by over 4500 employees who blog today (voluntarily at Microsoft) and the work done by my team on</p>
<p><a class="link" href="http://channel9.msdn.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >Channels 9</a> and <a class="link" href="http://on10.net/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >10</a>.¬†¬† The interview process with Wired would serve to be very different than any I‚Äôd been part of previously.¬† Throughout the process I‚Äôd spend countless hours with Fred.¬† Fred conducted phone interviews with me, shadowed my team at the Consumer Electronics Show and spent a full day on the Microsoft campus with me and my team.¬† Fred saw firsthand how we filmed interviews and published in real-time, he had unbridled access.¬†¬†¬† Throughout it all Fred took pages and pages of feverish notes.¬†¬† I like to think he got to know a lot about me and I enjoyed my time with him.</p> <p class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt">As the interview process when on I learnt from Fred too.¬† Wired is struggling to understand how to embrace this new world of transparency.¬†¬† ‚ÄúIn the mainstream world of scoops and exclusive stories how can you be transparent too?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat happens to the magazine if we push every story online in the beginning?‚Äù¬† Fred marveled at our use of technology to create Channel 9 and was envious of our use of tech to get a story out in a timely manner.¬†¬† It was obvious that this interview would also serve as learning experience for Wired.¬†¬† The irony in this is not lost on me that a Magazine that doesn‚Äôt usually speak favorably about our company was listening very closely to what we did and how we did it for Channel 9.¬† It will be interesting to watch and see what happens with <a class="link" href="http://www.wired.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >www.Wired.com</a> as they integrate the lessons learned from this interview.</p> <p class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt">If you flash forward to today, many months later the story has finally shipped in the magazine and is also <a class="link" href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/15.04/wired40_microsoft.html"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >available online</a>.¬† There are a number of gems in this piece that talk about the traffic growth of Channel 9, the explosion of employee blogs at Microsoft and how it began.¬† Unfortunately though attempts to invent tension that really wasn‚Äôt there.¬†¬† Transparency did take a huge leap forward via Channel 9 and blogging, but that is not where it all began, it had already started.¬† Transparency is something that has been happening at Microsoft for a long time.¬† Much of this work actually began all the way back on CompuServe forums where our employees began answering questions.¬†¬† Since then folks at Microsoft have been connecting with customers in any way they can.¬† Employees have done so online, <a class="link" href="http://www.visitmix.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >at our conferences</a>, over lunch, through newsgroups, forums and today via <a class="link" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >blogs</a>.¬† Our employees are very proud of the work we‚Äôre doing, we know we‚Äôre not flawless and that is why we are out in those conversations every day.¬† We do this to learn and hopefully in a ‚ÄúListening to learn‚Äù fashion, a name that I chose for this blog when I first began it.¬† Blogging and Channel 9 take this all to a new level and helps put a human face on our company. </p> <p class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt">Channel 9 was created by a dream team of individuals and I am thankful every day for the experience and being able to be a part of that.¬† The article does a very poor job of spelling out who those folks were and the right decisions made that have gotten us to today.¬†¬† Over time I believe it is important to get that story out and is something I plan to do more of via this blog.¬† </p></p>
<p>Fred makes a bunch of noise over on his blog <a class="link" href="http://blog.wired.com/business/2007/03/enough_about_me.html"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >about the background information</a> that was accidentally sent to him.¬† It is unfortunate that he was accidentally sent to him, but I believe if you look at the overall story timeline here (he started this process all the way back in October folks) I think its pretty understandable that we have folks assisting us in providing background information, etc.¬† Another interesting part that I almost forgot (as this all started so long ago) was that I was able to turn the tables on Fred and interview him over lunch in Vegas at CES.¬† I‚Äôve posted that interview <a class="link" href="http://www.on10.net/Blogs/larry/wired-magazine-intervewer-interview/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >here on Channel 10</a>.¬†<p class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt">So that‚Äôs about it on this from me today, It will be interesting to watch my favorite news aggregation site Techmeme</p>
<p><a class="link" href="http://www.techmeme.com/070328/p10#a070328p10"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >cover the rest</a>.</p></p>
<p><em>Update: I change the link to the <a class="link" href="http://www.on10.net/Blogs/larry/wired-magazine-intervewer-interview/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >Channel 10 interview with Fred</a> to a proper permalink on the site.</em></p>
