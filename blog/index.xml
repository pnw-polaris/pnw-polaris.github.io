      <description>Last summer our oldest daughter was married and I had the awesome responsibility of saying a few words at the wedding reception to the newly married bride and groom.
I do a fair amount of speaking in my job as an Evangelist at Microsoft, but this was a very different talk. After a lot of thought (over months) on what to talk about, I came to the decision that I should relay one of the better pieces of advice that I have received.</description>

      <description>It snowed again this morning at our home in Fall City, Washington. I’m not sure when this cruel joke of winter will be over here. I moved away from Saskatchewan to leave snow. Although to keep it in perspective, it hasn’t really been cold. 🙂
Making up for it all was this amazing photo that my wife captured this morning. Great show of a hummingbird braving the winter for a drink in our backyard.</description>

      <description>I’m a major fan of the television program Diners Drive-Ins and Dives. This show with Guy Fieri goes across the United States popping into great places with good food. Here in Seattle I’ve eaten a few times at Voula’s Offshore Cafe which has been on the show. You have to eat their Greek Hobo.
I’m actually on a secret mission (guess its not a secret now) to eat at all of the places that Guy Fieri frequents on his popular Food Network show.</description>

      <description>Once again for Mix, my team worked on what we call the live experience. Since PDC 2003, we’ve been working on ways for the folks at home and those attending in person can make a connection to the event.

With this work we’ve streamed the keynotes live, published breakout sessions for on demand viewing, filmed behind the scenes videos for Channel 9 along with some humorous ones and even overlaid Tweets tagged #MIX09 on top of the live keynote player on the web site and on the big screens in the keynote halll via our Flotzam screen saver.</description>

      <description>My 9 year old daughter is a major fan of Disney’s Club Penguin. She loves to go online in this virtual world, hanging out with her friends, updating her status and buying virtual items to trick out her igloo.

Josie was sad this week when she attempted to login to Club Penguin and was denied access.

      <title>Selectively Synchronizing Facebook and Twitter Status</title>

      <description>One of my more popular blog posts is where I explain how to push your Facebook status to Twitter. When I wrote this, about two years ago, people were more likely to update their Facebook status than Twitter. My hack with TwitterFeed made it simple to push that status update to Twitter.
Times have changed since then and I find myself updating my status to Twitter and wanting to be selective about what I update Facebook with my Twitter status.</description>

      <description>Today, my team has released Oxite. Oxite is an open source, standards compliant, and highly extensible content management platform that can run anything from blogs to big web sites. We are releasing this as our second edition of the Mix Online web magazine that focusses on web standards. Oxite began as a side project of Adam Kinney and Duncan Mackenzie and is a subset of the Channel 9 source code. When it was time to do a reboot of the Mix Online web site Duncan and his team created an experience where could release the source code (a popular customer request of Channel 9) that used ASP.</description>

      <description>I promised that I would be back.
I am.
It has been a very exciting time with Microsoft PDC week now here. One of the things that is new from my team is the PDC live event coverage.
On the homepage of the PDC Website, you are able to watch the day 1 and 2 keynotes live. We’ve also superimposed recent activity from Twitter alongside the keynote stream. This is one of my favorite parts of the experience.</description>

      <guid>https://jeffsandquist.com/blog/bill-gates-transitions-to-the-foundation/</guid>
      <description>This morning we posted a very special interview on Channel 9 with Bill Gates. In this video interview, Charles Torre sits down with Bill Gates and they talk about everything from philantropy, the CSA role, competition with Google and platforms.
I believe this will go down as one of our greatest Channel 9 interviews of all time and with a little over 1600 videos produced to date, that is saying something.</description>

      <description>Today we completed the deployment of Channel 9 Version 4.0. We’re still doing some final stabilization work that includes tweaking performance, but we’re on our way. This is a 100 per cent rewrite of the predecessor and has been a long time in the making.
A little over five years ago Channel 9 came on the air, some would say ushering in a wave of transparency for Microsoft and becoming a poster child for corporate blogging.</description>

      <description>For the past five and a half years, I’ve been running DasBlog. It has served me well over the years and I’m really appreciative of Chris Anderson for giving it a start with BlogX and finally to Clemens, Omar and Scott for moving it along as DasBlog.
For quite some time I have wanted to make a move to something that had more extensibility, better themes and more of a self service admin.</description>

      <description>Jon Udell joined our team this past year. In a short period of time he has played a huge role in help shape the content and approaches we take in creating content for the Evangelism Network. (Better know as the network of communities including Channels 8, 9, 10, Mix Online and TechNet Edge.
Today Jon is launching a new Microsoft-oriented interview series called Perspectives. The show covers a variety of topics including robotics, digital identity, e-science, and social software.</description>

We’ll have something for everyone. All the cool demos and deep dives with the partners along with the keynote stream are on Mix Online. On Channel 9, for the hardcore Developers we’ll have deep dives with the folks who build the product.</description>

      <description>Ok, this will hopefully go down as one of those announcements as, “Man, it is about time someone did this!”. Tonight, over on Channel 8 Bill Gates is announcing Microsoft DreamSpark.
With DreamSpark on Channel 8 students can download Visual Studio , Expression and Windows Server. These aren’t limited editions or time bombed copies either, its the full meal deal.
Today, DreamSpark we are going live in 10 countries, including Belgium, China, Finland, France, Germany, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the U.</description>

Guess what? We have room for one more. Over on Duncan’s team we have an opening. Come join the Microsoft team that works hard, plays hard and is changing how Microsoft connects with the community through social media.</description>

      <description>Man, what a wild ride the last couple of months have been. As usual we’re going full tilt, building out the code that drives the Evangelism Network and the content that keeps people coming back for more. 🙂 It has been a while since I’ve blogged about what’s going on in my life and there has been plenty going on at work and at home. I figured I’d update you all about work, my life at home is pretty well documented thanks to Flickr and Facebook.</description>

      <description>We found our Yogi Bear. Dan Fernandez has joined our team and will be a new addition to the Channel 9 team, a new partner in crime for Commander Torre. I’ve known Dan for sometime and have always enjoyed working with him. One of the first things we did together was a Summer of Express contest on Channel 9 back in 2004. Dan’s definitely familiar with what we do (he was the 41st person to register on Channel 9), but will bring plenty of new ideas to the team.</description>

      <description>An article in today’s Seattle Times, caught both both the eye of myself and my neighbor:
 After years of pushing for a mountain-bike “skills park” on the Sammamish Plateau, the Backcountry Bicycle Trails Club got a $150,000 boost from King County to move forward with its plans, county officials announced Wednesday.
The club signed an agreement to work with the county on developing the 120-acre project at Duthie Hill Park, a swath of second-growth conifers and deciduous trees that is underused, county officials say.</description>

      <description>Today was Charles Fitzgerald’s last day at Microsoft. He will be missed and it is a sad day for many of us at the company, to see him move on. I will miss his brutal honesty, book recommendations and never-ending support for the community work my team does with Channels 8,9, 10 and Edge.
An anonymous commenter over on Mini, nailed it when they wrote the following about Charles:
 If you ever sat in any of his presentations at places like the Platform Strategy Review events, and talked with our top customers, he ‘got’ them and they ‘got’ him.</description>

      <description>A couple of years back I created a set of Wikis. The first was to help folks track resources for David Allen’s Getting Things Done Methodology. The second was to help people find power outlets in airports.
Over the years both of these sites have flourished in popularity. The AirPower wiki in particular has been written up in a variety of travel magazines and the Getting Things Done Tools list sees very regular updates.</description>

We’re looking forward to it and won’t miss the trek from Fall City to Redmond.</description>

I can imagine Webkinz broke all sorts of sales records for itself, today. As I was saying back in October:Mark my words, Webkinz will be one of the top toys this holiday seasons for kids ages 6 – 13+. The site has been overloaded today, making it difficult and sometimes impossible login at times due to a large volume of traffic. Here’s a screenshot from the

      <description>Welcome to TechNet Edge
Just doing a quick test of embedding TechNet Edge videos in my blog via Silverlight. TechNet Edge is a new community for IT Pros and a sister site to Channels 8, 9, 10 and Mix Online.
We’re still in the process of taking this site live and won’t be open officially for business until Monday morning. You can go over now and play as we stabilize though.</description>

      <description>Registration for Mix’08 is now live. My team has been working literally around the clock moving Mix Online to the EvNet 4.0 Codebase. I’ve talked about EvNet 4.0 previously, in a nutshell this is a common set of code drives Channels 8,9, 10 , Mix Online and something new we’re calling TechNet Edge. EvNet 4.0 is lean, localizable and for the future. This post is mostly about testing our new “sharable” Silverlight player than anything else.</description>

      <description>The first episode of our Channel 10 series called “Show us your home” is now online. I talked about this a little while back here.
The goal of this series is take folks into the homes of a wide variety of geeks, both inside and outside of our company. The high order bit of course is not the home itself, but the use of technology. Think about it, Channel 9 brought you inside the halls of Microsoft, now Channel 10 will take you to their homes.</description>

      <description>I love it when software developers allow their sense of humor to bubble up. The Twitter folks do a good job of this in their error messages.

I do like the error messages my team is now now surfacing up for file not founds. 😉 I wonder what else we could do. It is a subtle thing to remind folks that there are actual human beings writing software, not machines.</description>

A real conversation from last night at dinner between our daughters Josie (8 years old) and Brynn (21 years old). Brynn of course is part of the Facebook generation (more here). Josie is part of an equal phenomena known as Webkinz World.</description>

      <description>Yes me. 🙂 I’ve been in a few team interviews with my team who create Channel 9, but for whatever reason I’ve never had the camera turned around on me. I prefer to be the “behind the scenes guy” managing the chaos.
Last week though, Rory grabbed a camera and interviewed me for Channel 9.   View this video over on Channel 9 &amp;lt;center&amp;gt; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;/center&amp;gt;  This is one of the final interviews Rory did at Microsoft.</description>

      <description>If you watch one piece of media this year, please make it this one. It is about 90 minutes in length and is absolutely riveting. I’m actually listening to it again this morning as I work through email.
 Carnegie Mellon Professor Randy Pausch, who is dying from pancreatic cancer, gave his last lecture at the university Sept. 18, 2007, before … all » a packed McConomy Auditorium. In his moving talk, “Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams,” Pausch talked about his lessons learned and gave advice to students on how to achieve their own career and personal goals.</description>

      <description>I’ve been back on the job for a little over three weeks, returning from my sabbatical from Microsoft. A lot of folks ask me what it is like to be back and wonder how it is going though. So I thought I’d write a few paragraphs here to explain.
In many ways my return to my team reminds of a lot of a speeding locomotive. The locomotive is speeding down the tracks at over 100 miles per hour and I needed to get on.</description>

I haven’t been able to find many details online, but the undressed sites say that the mall will rival Bellevue Square / Redmond Town Center in size. If you have more information on the project, please drop me a line via the comments on the blog so I can keep this post up to date with the latest news.</description>

      <description>It seems just like yesterday that I was headed off on my sabbatical from Microsoft. This has been a break chalked full of memories that I will have for a lifetime. As I prepare for the burn of reentry, I thought it would be useful to pen some random thoughts about my break. There have been so many highlights. The massive road trip that Josie and I took, making peace with my past, getting involved with the Skate Like A Girl non-profit, laser eye surgery spending time with my wonderful wife Lauri , hanging with our cool dog Brady and getting to know my neighbors.</description>

Check out a fun little game that Josie and her neighborhood friends came up with today. Living in a new neighborhood means lots of people unpacking. With unpacking you have a lot of bubble wrap on hand.
For great fun, all you need is a Razor Scooter, a fresh roll of bubble wrap and your friends.

      <description>The place that I grew up at on Holmgren Bay in Estevan, Saskatchewan has now been sold. Estevan, an area rich is natural resources, is booming right now. There is a lack of housing now so the sale was very quick.
Mom and Dad will be moving out to condo life on the west coat of Canada taking new roots in Kelowna, B.C. For Mom and Dad this will mean a warmer climate, the end of yard maintenance and a much shorter trip to visit us down in Fall City, Washington.</description>

      <description>With the addition of public facing feeds to Facebook I am now able to publish my status on Facebook to Twitter. Here’s how you can do it also.
First, find your status RSS feed on Facebook. It is buried. (Thanks Bizzle! for helping me find mine.) To find it, you need to visit your profile on Facebook and on your mini-feed select &amp;ldquo;See All&amp;rdquo;. On the right you will see a list of items, select “status stories” and finally below this a feed link can be found.</description>

      <title>Amazon to open grocery service? Amazon Fresh</title>

      <description>Is Amazon opening up a grocery service? I spotted this interesting truck today in Bellevue, Washington. 
I sure hope they are opening a grocery service. Our family loved the now defunct HomeGrocer.com service from the late 90s. We were &amp;ldquo;beta testers&amp;rdquo; and used it as our only grocery service for quite some time.
The services Safeway and Albertsons have opened just don’t compare to what was Home Grocer.
Anyone have a link to Amazon Fresh or a beta invite?</description>

      <description>Check out Rush Frisby’s Flickr Wallpaper Rotator application, written using .NET Framework 2.0
This tray application cycles through your desktop background to a photo from Flickr. You can specify tags, user names with how often you want the background image to change.
I have mine set to feature pictures from the Flickr colorful tag every couple of hours.
Cool.

      <description>I am feeling great, rested and healthy. Although I am still recovering from the Custom PRK Laser Eye surgery, every day my vision is improving. In the mornings I can see well enough to use a computer, but by evening that is an impossibility.
I hope you are having a great summer too.</description>

      <title>Microsoft On Facebook: 17,802 Strong</title>

      <description>Over on WinBeta they are writing:
 Microsoft has a giant presence on Facebook, with over 17,000 employees (out of 70,000 worldwide) joining their Facebook network. Since you need a Microsoft email address to get it, it’s highly unlikely these are anything but real Microsofties, and the large number means Facebook is becoming a pretty important means of communication inside MS.
You’ll be able to find the real profile of Bill Gates in there, and discover that he has only 57 friends, while Ray Ozzie has 105 friends, including Mike Arrington, Steve Ballmer, Don Box, Joanne Bradford, Steve Case, Steve Chen, Anil Dash, Gary Flake, Steven Levy of Newsweek, Dare Obasanjo, Jeff Sandquist, Robert Scoble, and Mark Zuckerberg.</description>

      <description>An old family friend, George Symons has passed away. In many ways Geroge was like a grand father and his entire family was a big part of my family.
Many folks back in Estevan believe I am related to the Symons Family. We’re not, at least not by blood. In fact some of the best family are the ones you choose.
I got to know George and family when my mother went to work for them running their grocery wholesale business back in the 80’s.</description>

      <description>I haven’t updated this blog with my recovery progress since having PRK. PRK is a laser eye procedure different than Lasik. PRK has a much longer recovery time. The goal of both Lasik and PRK is the same, which is to enable people to see without glasses. I had wavefront guided custom PRK.
For the first few days with PRK there was a great deal of discomfort and it has taken about a week to regain semi-functional vision without the use of eyeglasses.</description>

      <description>Today is the day for my PRK Laser Eye Surgery. From reading the forums on USA Eyes, it sounds like I am not going to want to be on the computer for a number of days due to vision fuzziness. I also won’t have the ability to drive for a number of days.
I’ve loaded up an MP3 player with audio books and music to help pass the time.
I’ll post updates on how the surgery has gone as my new vision allows.</description>

Stores in twelve cities in Canada and the United States have received the make over. In addition to changing the signage they have launched new products too.</description>

      <description>Lasik surgery that is.
For over 25 years I’ve worn glasses. Without my glasses I am useless. I’ve tried contact lenses but have had problems with getting them in my eyes.
Thursday though, hopefully will be the end of my relationship with eyeglasses. I am going in for Lasik surgery. Technically it is not Lasik that I am getting. Due to some anomalies with my eyes I will need to have PRK (Photorefractive Keratectomy) instead.</description>

      <description>Josie has been asking to cut her hair for a while now – finally Lauri relented after one too many tangles and a few too many arguments.
We’ve heard of Locks of Love and we were explaining to Josie how long its taken to grow her hair from super-short to just at her bum (2 solid years) and she really didn’t care. Ah well, it’s just hair, right? 🙂
So, with one cut, Josie lost nearly 12 inches of hair and then Lauri spent another 15 minutes evening it all up and she has a cute new summer ‘do.</description>

 “Michael Arrington was sound asleep in his bedroom in Atherton, California, when three men burst in. Naturally, he was startled. His first reaction, he recalls, was to tell them to “get the fuck out.” But he quickly realized they meant no harm.</description>

It wasn’t long ago that Sam The Record Man was Canada’s largest music retailer with 130 stores Canada wide. Now only three locations will remain.
Sam The Record Man was the store where I purchased my very first album, Kiss Alive II.</description>

Things sure look different from above. We saw the Alameda Reservoir/Dam, the Shand Power Generation Plant, Estevan Comprehensive High School and a number of other places.
My favorite view of all was Benson, Saskatchewan. This is the small town of about one hundred people where I grew up.</description>

Kevin Armstrong and I took our girls out on Boundary Reservoir for a day of boating. Kevin recently purchased an eighteen foot Sea Ray and we had a great afternoon out on it. We went cruising, tubing and swimming. The water in Boundary Reservoir is nice and warm.</description>

      <description>Friday morning, around 7 am, Lauri noticed a little hummingbird in our backyard, trying to get something out of the globe lights around our umbrella. Interesting.
Around 7 am this morning, the hummingbird was back, only this time it was sticking its long beak into the orange bell shaped blossoms on our Thompson Maple tree that we had planted when my folks were in town. She had looked up online what to put in the feeders, and boiled some water, let it cool down and added the sugar.</description>

      <description>Think you can predict the future of tech? 🙂 Check out this post by Jon Udell from almost 5 years ago:
 Duncan Wilcox ruminates on how blogs can help implement the communication strategies outlined in the Cluetrain manifesto:
 Of course it’s not as if starting a weblog automatically opens a corporation up to conversations, but it’s a good start. For example reading Ray Ozzie’s weblog has made me very interested in Groove (the product) and generally makes me feel good about Groove (the company) � in long term that would make me trust both.</description>

      <description>This year I’ll celebrate eleven years at Microsoft. In September of 1996 I maxed out a credit card to relocate from Estevan, Saskatchewan to Redmond, Washington joining up with Microsoft as a contractor. As a contractor I didn’t qualify for relocation benefits, but I figured it was a worthy risk :-). My first job was to support the beta of Active Server Pages along with Internet Studio. Later on I made the transition to full-time employee status, supporting the released editions of these new Internet products.</description>

      <title>Inch by inch to Channel 9 Version 4.0</title>

      <description>Robert Scoble in a post about Zoomr made a reference to my motto of inch by inch. This phrase has been a part of my vocabulary since the summer of 2002, after seeing a Microsoft internal parody video of Al Pacino’s speech from Any Given Sunday. When success with a certain problem/project seems insurmountable it makes sense to retreat to a shorter term goal. Once you make that goal, move onto the next and eventually you will make that touchdown.</description>

      <description>As mentioned previously, my wife gave me a day of Performance Driving Training as an early birthday gift. On Tuesday this week I spent the day at Pacific Raceways road course in a class led by Don Kitch. The driving would be done my in my own car, a Corvette.
The day began at 8:00 am sharp (after signing off on a lengthy liability waiver) with an in class presentation by Don.</description>

      <description>It will be an extended long weekend for me. My Mom and Dad came into town and on Tuesday, I’ll be having my birthday present down at Pacific Raceway.
It has been a great weekend with the folks. You see my Dad has had quite the battle with Cancer and is recharging from several recent surgeries. You know how they say, “When it rains, it pours ?” In our family it has been a total moonsoon on the family health front.</description>

      <description>We have a hot tub that I use very regularly. I have rheumatoid arthritis and the hot tub really helps me sleep at night. It is definitely a keeper. 🙂
To be honest though I don’t like the look of it on our patio. My wife and I have begun to think through the plans for our new backyard and have been trying to decide what to do with the hot tub.</description>

Interesting, definitely looks a lot more feature rich than Flexwiki.</description>

      <description>I watched the CEO Summit live on the web this year. It is cool that they streamed Bill’s keynote and you can watch it now on demand. My favorite part was the following section about 10 minutes in:The last thing here I wanted to mention is that with video arriving on the Internet, it’s possible for a company to create essentially their own TV channel. And it’s actually better than a TV channel in that people can come in and watch at any time video on demand.</description>

      <description>I’ve played with Gallery Player a bit in the past via a Media Center PC. Amazing photographs, stunning visuals and lots of variety in content. I didn’t keep using the product though and had forgotten about the company.
While browsing Comcast HD on demand the other day I found a Gallery Player option. Turns out Gallery Player is now available via Comcast on Demand. The collections are in high defintion, have music in the background and are really cool to put up while not watching TV.</description>

      <description>In the spring of 2003 Microsoft opened its kimono with Channel 9 and today we’re popping our fly. 🙂 Sorry, couldn’t resist, cool name though. I’ve been a fanboy of Project Springfield since I heard about it late last summer. In a nutshell Popfly is an easy way to build mashups, gadgets, Web pages, and applications. Rory interviewed the team behind the project earlier this week and posted a video to Channel 9 a few moments ago with the team and John Montgomery piles on with The Genesis of Popfly and why he thinks it is cool over on his blog.</description>

      <description>Very cool that J. Allard kept up his end of the bargain when he lost a bet with N’Gai Croal from Newsweek. If the PSP outpaced the sales rate of the PS2 in the United States J. would dawn N’Gai’s hairstyle (dreadlocks) and if it didn’t N’Gai would get a buzz cut.
J. lost.
J’s bio page has been temporarily replaced on the Microsoft.com bio page to include his updated photo.</description>

These are awesome. My favorite sample is Monotone, check out the music is in perfect timing withe visuals. Lutz has also created a cool Boulderdash clone and an in-page MP3 player. Full source is available from the samples page.</description>

      <description>The Microsoft automated phone system actually does work [as well as Scoble says][1]:
Microsoft has a really cool voice-controlled system. You dial the number, an electronic voice answers and asks you for the person’s name you’re trying to reach. You SAY it. “Jeff Sandquist” and then it comes back with a recording of Jeff Sandquist so you know you’re going to the right place. “Are you looking for ‘Jeff Sandquist, Channel 9′”?</description>

      <description>I still eat Ramen Noodles. It drives my wife crazy and I can probably do without all the sodium, but they are so quick and easy. Perfect “guy snack food”. I boil them, drain most of the water and add the flavour package as seasoning. When I want to go “upscale” I visit the official ramen noodle blog and grab a recipe. There is also a book I’ve been meaning to add to our cook book collection, 101 Ways to Eat Ramen Noodles.</description>

      <description>One of my favorite movies in the 80s was Wall Street. In fact one of my best friends Kevin Armstrong and I, with great pride would recite the famous, “Greed is Good Speech” on demand. We were in high school and it was a fun parlor trick for social studies class. Kevin learnt it from watching the movie on VHS over and over. I was a closet geek and used Cinemania on my multimedia PC.</description>

      <description>Joshua just posted a fun video over on the Mix site with Rory interviewing the Beijing Olympic Technical Team. Great moments in this interview include getting mascots through immigration, godzilla impersonations and their use of Silverlight for the Beijing Games. 🙂
On a much more technical note Laurence Moroney has a great blog post where he explains the two installation modes for Silverlight – direct and indirect.
Check out the Beijing Mascots!</description>

      <description>People definitely have gotten a better idea of what the folks behind software at Microsoft are like with our bloggers and Channels 9 + 10. Transparency has helped change how many perceive our company and at the very least has made the last 3 years of my life a lot more interesting. 🙂
Awhile back when looking for bloggers outside of the tech business I came across Trench Doc. Trench Doc is written by a Doctor who works the emergency room at a “Southern Regional Medical Mecca”.</description>

      <description>It worked. 🙂
The move to FeedBurner should be complete. Note to folks who plan on doing this with Dasblog. The configuration page in Dasblog asks for your FeedBurner username. It doesn’t really want that.
My username for FeedBurner is JeffSand, but my feed is http://feeds.feedburner.com/jeffsandquist, so on the configuration page for DasBlog I had to specify JeffSandquist, not JeffSand.
I think if you make this mistake you potentially could lose subscribers if their aggregator gets an incorrect 302 message from DasBlog.</description>

      <description>I’m moving the RSS feed for this blog to Feedburner. Omar and Scott  made the switch quite some time ago and from reading their blogs they are happy with it. For most of you, no action should be required as Dasblog 1.9 will automatically redirect your RSS Aggregator to my new feed.
I like the idea of off-loading bandwith and the improved statistics that come with Feedburner. There are some risks in outsourcing syndication.</description>

      <description>I love to cook. There is nothing more relaxing and stress relieving for me than finding a recipe, following the steps, maybe improvising a bit and tasting the final results. 🙂 Over the years we’ve assembled quite a cookbook collection in our home. Some of my favorites are from way back in the past. What’s cool about the older cookbooks that we have is that they are handwritten. Many were created for family reunions, anniversaries and homecomings with family members submitting their recipes.</description>

Still some tweaks left to do (need to reenable search, cleanup the comments form) but that is going to have to wait.</description>

      <description>Continued from before….Step 6: The border is complete, it was a lot harder to get the alternating colours looking like we wanted them to, they look ok but honestly we are worried once we apply the object lines they will look too busy.
Step 7: Bribe the handyman from our builder with a Thomas Kemper Soda variety pack (he doesn’t drink wine or beer) to create a frame with left over millwork.</description>

[Should Fred go to Mix?][1]
If you remember a little while back my team and I were part of an experiment in radical transparency with Wired Magazine. Today begins part two of that same experiment. It turns out that Fred Vogelstein was slow in registering for the Mix Event that we’re holding in Las Vegas next week, we’re sold out and last weekend he asked if we could find a spot for him.</description>

      <description>I’m listening to more and more podcasts on my drive into work in the morning and the main feed from Gigavox’s IT Conversations Network rarely dissapoints. This morning I really enjoyed a talk Lou Carbone gave on Creating Customer Loyalty.
 Lou Carbone, author and CEO of Experience Engineering, Inc. will change the way you think about customer experience forever. His message to business leaders and professionals is simple: Create customers that come back and customers that tell others, by connecting emotionally with them through the experiences you deliver.</description>

Ok, we took a brief interlude. Josie couldn’t wait to use it so we seasoned the chalkboard after the final coat of paint had dried. To season we took a piece of chalk and slid it end to end on the wall using the side of the chalk. We completely covered the wall in chalk. Once that was done we took a damp piece of cloth and wiped all the chalk off.</description>

After working as an industry analyst for more than decade, I’m leaving JupiterResearch to join Microsoft as an enthusiast evangelist. What is an enthusiast evangelist? Our job is to find, engage and work with enthusiasts and other influencers and show them all the cool stuff that Microsoft is doing. In short, it’s our job to act as the bridge between Microsoft and end users.</description>

One minute our home was sold, then the next the other the deal would fall through. Truth be told our home actually sold three times until the deal was finally done.</description>

      <description>Tonight I got home a little after 5:00 pm. Which is early for me, what was nice is that there was still some light out and I was able to get out with Josie tonight and help her with her skateboard.
For those not following along at home I was a skate in my younger years and last year started to get our youngest daughter into skating. She did pretty good last year learning the fundamentals, but to be honest she was a little young.</description>

      <description>It is with great interest that I am watching the discussion surrounding Scoble LinkGate 2007. For those not following along at home, Robert blew a gasket this weekend when his exclusive video coverage of the Intel 45 Nanometer announcement did not get links from Slashdot.org, Engadget or Gizmodo. The result of course is that TechMeme is full of discussion on this today. Robert continues to pile on today with his pissing off the blogosphere post.</description>

      <description>Sorry for the lag in posts as of late, between CES, our home sale and a number of new projects at work I have not been posting much here. You know your blog is out of date when even your wife comes up to you and says, &amp;ldquo;Hey! Can you please put something new up there!&amp;rdquo; 🙂 So this one is for you Lauri.
There’s been a lot going on. Our home is still under contract to sell.</description>

      <description>Ok, our house went back on the market yesterday after the original deal fell through. Within hours we had another offer and have accepted it. I think I’m going to stop blogging about our home sale until we’re closed. 🙂 Needless to say we’re happy that this is moving along again.

It may be cold here today in Sammamish at 20 degrees Fahrenheit (-7 degrees celcius), but it doesn&amp;#8217;t come anywhere close to Estevan where I grew up.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Estevan right now is at -6 Degrees Fahrenheit (-21 degrees celcius).&amp;nbsp; That temperature is actually a high for Estevan this week.&amp;nbsp; Dad was telling me the other day that it was down to -31 celcius most days.</description>

      <description>Like many folks, tonight I’m recuperating from a great week at CES. Channel 10 gave an exclusive look at a lot of new products from Microsoft and the industry as a whole. We’ve actually got a few more videos to get up over the next few days. The week was more stressful than ever as we’re in the final stages of selling our current home and finalizing the purchase of another.</description>

 A brand new operating system that runs headless – Windows Home Server.
 IPTV comes to the XBox 360

      <description>Greetings from Las Vegas. I am down here with the folks from my Channel 10 team covering CES. For the last two weeks we’ve been very busy, interviewing all the folks behind the key Microsoft announcements that you’ll see during tonight’s Bill Gates keynote. (live streaming link)
We will start shipping out content once the keynote goes live tonight. Lots of fun surprises, check them out at http://on10.net
In addition to the Microsoft coverage, we’ll be sending up videos each day from the event covering what we find cool and interesting from the tradeshow floor.</description>

Ray Ozzi and Scott Guthrie will be doing the keynotes.
One interesting thing you’ll notice if you look closely at VisitMix.com is that it is running the same code as Channel 10.</description>

What makes it interesting to me is that even though many of us write about the adventures in our lives in detail and we seem to watch each other live through transpaency, it really only goes so far.</description>

      <description>Well, that was quick. As I mentioned previously we’re putting our home up for sale (the for sale sign went up on December 30th) and in the last 48 hours we’ve had 5 families through the home. I was surprised to see this much traffic over New Years Eve and day, but the Real Estate agent said New Years day can be a popular day for homes to sell. The flow did keep me optimistic and I figured we’d get an offer quickly, but wow what a thrill tonight we received an offer and have accepted.</description>

      <description>We’re on day four without power to our home in Sammamish after the terrible windstorm that hit the sound on Thursday night. As of this morning our home is still without electricity or phone service (mobile or landline). Last night was a cold one with no heat in the house and temperatures outside dropping below freezing. Lines at the gas stations where there is power are over a mile in length.</description>

      <description>You know those secrets that you just want to tell everyone about, but can’t? I’ve had one of those for the last couple of months. 🙂
I guess it was back in October my good friend Mr. John Montgomery sent me a note saying that I really needed to get to know Jon Udell better. From there a series of wonderful emails, phone conversations and face to face discussions occured on a Redmond trip to meet the team.</description>

Do you suck them very slowly, or crunch them very fast?
Eat that candy-coated chocolate, but tell me when I ask:
When you eat your Smarties, do you eat the red ones last?

      <description>Ok, I have to admit I was a little worried the other day when Laura told me she wrote a song and that she was going to create a video too. :-&amp;gt; 
One of those things about having a very creative team is you’re bound to get a lot surprises. Anyhow, her song it brilliant, and the video turned out great! 🙂 Now that’s evangelism baby. 🙂 The interesting thing, it isn’t the first song written in my team, back at PDC’05 Michael Lehman wrote the Channel 9 song.</description>

      <description>I received a happy email from my mom tonight where she said my hometown of Estevan, Saskatchewan has been selected for a possible clean coal project. Estevan is know as the Energy Capital of the province of Saskatchewan. The area is rich in natural resources like oil, natural gas and coal. Currently it has two major power generating facilities with Shand and Boundary Dam. This would be its third, but I assume Boundary Dam would be decommisioned if this went forward.</description>

      <description>Looks like I am not the only one who found this “Top Ten Girl Geeks” on CNET offensive. Well, they at least they included Ada Byron and Grace Hopper, but blew it when they put them alongside Lisa Simpson and Ashley Simpon. As CrunchNotes mentions someone actually took the time to write this and another person edited it. They should be ashamed. Including Grace Hopper along the sides of Lisa Simpson is a disgrace and I won’t even start about Paris Hilton.</description>

      <description>We were having one our regular team demofest’s today and Jeremy Mazner (who just returned from parental leave at Microsoft) demonstrated a very cool WPF application that uses the Flickr API to show your photo collection. It enables tagging, uploading and slideshows. It rocks. What is even cooler is that its written by Thirteen 23, not Microsoft.
This is an amazing replacement for Flickr Backup a Java application that I have used for quite some time to keep a local backup copy of my Flickr photos.</description>

      <description>You’ve got to love Steve, great sense of humour. In a recent CNET Article when asked, “Can we talk about Europe?”
Steve responds, “Beautiful place. I lived in Brussels for three years as a kid. I do love Brussels.”

      <description>Looking to try out MSN Soapbox? We’ve got beta invites over on 10 and an interview with Rob Bennett from the team.
The thing that really impresses me with Soapbox is the video quality. I’ve used You Tube in the past but was very dissapointed with the video quality in that the compression makes the videos almost unwatchable. Soapbox appears to not be grainy a you tube. We’re looking for folks to create their own videos for 9/10.</description>

      <description>For quite some time I’ve been a huge fan of Harmony Remote Controls. As a passionate customer I think I’ve personally sold at least 10 of these remotes to friends and most likely even more through this blog. (Check out this mini review of the Harmony 880)
Well the 880 has been retired in our home and I’ve moved up to the Harmony 890 remote. The 890 is a bit more expensibe than the 880, but it was well worth the update.</description>

      <description>Well, although I was invited this year to it I missed Foo Camp. Too bad. Turns out even our new Chief Software Architect Ray Ozzie was able to make time to go the event. So my excuse of “the week getting away from me” really does not hold water. Heck, if Ray can make it, how can I be too busy? To be honest, it was an amazing week. It was the first week since India and some vacation time where I really got back into the flow of things at work and man, what a great week.</description>

The current one is about the definition of a blog began here and seemingly will end here.</description>

      <description>The National Corvette Homecoming (warning webpage with background sound 🙁 ) has been going on for 26 years now and was held again over the weekend in Bowling Green, Kentucky. You can connect with owners around the globe, get a plant tour and take a restoration seminar.
The passion behind Corvette owners is stunning. They attend events, have local clubs and go to things like this homecoming. People from around the planet.</description>

One thing I am reminded of when travelling abroad is how friendly we are when we run into someone we think is from our homeland.</description>

      <description>So it has been almost 24 hours since my A little freaked out in Dehli post. I was able to make alternative travel arrangements last night through corporate travel as there was a high probability that my flight out of Heathrow to Seattle could be cancelled on Sunday. (The BBC news is reporting 40% of flights out of Heathrow right now are cancelled). This does mean that I will be getting home about 24 hours sooner than planned, Saturday afternoon.</description>

      <description>Well after leaving Seattle Friday night at 7:00 pm we finally arrived in Delhi this morning at 6:15 am Sunday local time. We then had a driver take us by car up to Agra which was about a 5 hour drive through some of the most insane traffic I’ve ever experienced in my life.
It was an unbelievable drive, very surreal, I think my photos probably do more to describe the drive than words.</description>

We’re on our way to The Imagine Cup! We arrived at Hethrow from Seattle at around noon today (local time). This of course was 4:00 am on our body clocks so we were all a little messed up when we arrived. There is a 7 hour layover here today and then we continue on to Delhi so I was able to have a nice hot shower, changed my clothes and feel great!</description>

      <description>Charles on our Channel 9 team sits down with Paresh Suthar and Matt Augustine to talk about the Live Clipboard. Don’t know what Live Clipboard is? To get the meat check out Ray Ozzie’s original post entitled Wiring the Web. As Ray puts it…
The idea was based on using a simple and consistent user model to wire-the-web that would assist individuals in creating their own mesh of interconnections – both web-to-web and web-to-PC.</description>

Easy to use…
The integration with live gadgets is very hot… I also like the permissions features…

      <description>Excellent Piece by Seth Godin.
  If you want average (mediocre) work, ask for it. Be really clear up front that you want something beyond reproach, that’s in the middle of the road, that will cause no controversy and will echo your competition. It’ll save everyone a lot of time.  On the other hand, if you want great work, you’ll need to embrace some simple facts:  It’s going to offend someone.</description>

It happened during a really bad rainstorm when a truck hydroplaned, lost control and drove head on into his car.</description>

Well, today for me marks the end of a pretty amazing week and the beginning of a big year for my team at Microsoft.&amp;nbsp;I&amp;#8217;ve been down in Orlando, Florida all week attending MGX.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; MGX is an internal Microsoft conference for our global sales folks and our Evangelists worldwide. We use MGX to celebrate the accomplishments of the last year and communicate the strategy for the coming year to our teams around the year.</description>

Along with the 5 Temptations of a CEO, the 10 Commandments of Email is another great read.  Don’t use your in-box as a catchall folder for everything you need to work on. Read items once, and answer them immediately if necessary, delete them if possible, or move them to project-specific folders.  Set up a “Five Weeks Folder” that deletes its content automatically after five weeks. Use it as a repository for messages you’re unsure about, such as that email you want to delete, but you’re not sure if the guy’s going to call you tomorrow and ask about it.</description>

      <guid>https://jeffsandquist.com/blog/7-day-software-on-10/</guid>
      <description>Back in 2004 I wrote about how if a piece of software is good enough for seven days, I’ll buy it. Since then a number of other bloggers have picked this up as way to talk about good, quality software and services. The idea is that once you’ve used a piece of software for seven days you’ll know whether it is a keeper or not. In fact that is about the point that I decide to uninstall and never use sofware again if it is a dud.</description>

      <description>Saw this on Joystiq and over on Major Nelson so it must be true!
Every Wednesday this summer the XBox Live Arcade team will release a new title.
Kicking off with ‘Frogger’, fans of the Konami classic can download the game that first hit arcades in 1981 and once again be able to dodge traffic and eats flies with their frog, this time racking up Achievements along the way. There’s no better way to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Frogger and the launch of Xbox Live Arcade Wednesdays than downloading this latest title from the Xbox Live Arcade game portfolio.</description>

      <description>People throw the “community” word around a lot at Microsoft and throughout the industry. To be honest it is not one of my most favorite words or phrases even though my team’s mission is creating places like Channel 9 and 10.
I like to think of the end goal for sites like Channel 9 and 10 is to have something that resembles a music festival. If you attend a music festival like Bumbershoot or Farm Aid what you notice right away is that often the most interesting aspects of the event aren’t always happening on mainstage.</description>

I envied Kevin growing up as he spent many years in a wide variety of roles working on cruise ships.</description>

I’m looking to buy an old school tandem bicycle, something retro. It doesn’t need to be in great condition, the frame at least needs to be in solid shape with little to no rust. My plan is to strip it down to the metal, replace the components with modern ones and have it painted in similar fashion as</description>

I am a Windows Notepad user, I use it throughout the day to keep running notes from meetings that I later consolidate into meeting notes and actions. It works well. I should probably use OneNote or something but I like the simplicity of a basic text editor like notepad. So here’s one cool little trick for notepad that allows you to to automatically keep a simple date/time stamp in notepad as you open/add to a log.</description>

      <description>So last night at the recommendation of Jeff Erwin I picked up some of Patrick Lencioni’s books. I blazed through the Five Temptations of a CEO, it is a very quick read that you can easily get through in one sitting. Really good, common sense advice. The book is written as a short story that reminded me of David Chilton’s Wealthy Barber series.

In one of the comments Jeff Erwin recommends Patrick M. Lencioni’s books on leadership. He writes:“My best advice is to go purchase all five books written by Patrick M. Lencioni and read them each twice. This will take you about one day to do, they are fast reads and very interesting.</description>

      <description>Happy Canada Day! Of course we celebrate with a link to some classic Canadian beer commericals. My favorite is So I hear you’re from Canada. I’ve actually had similar experiences (not exact thank God) to this while living down here. A year ago today I got my first tattoo.</description>

      <description>Wow. This is cool Arin and Lora were kind enough to loan me a Samsung Origami (still can’t get used to saying Ultra Mobile PC) for some focus groups I’m involved with in San Francisco this coming week.
I’ll be honest I really wondered how useful a device like this would be. You see I always have a laptop open in my kitchen or in our family room. I’m an email/blog addict, just part of the lifestyle I guess.</description>

      <description>__Yes, its true, Vic Gundotra is leaving Microsoft for Google.
Unless you have been on vacation in some remote location I’m sure you have already read the news that Vic has decided to make the move to Google after 15 years at Microsoft.
I’ve worked for Vic pretty much my entire career at Microsoft. Through it all he has been an inspiration to me and my teams and also someone who I look up to.</description>

      <description>I’d really like to buy an espresso machine for home. If anyone out there can point me to some tips on buying the right machine, please let me know via the comments.
Some background:
 It is to be used at home It is just for me (my wife drinks chai) It should be easy to keep clean It can’t be crazy expensive It shouldn’t be too big on the countertop and should look cool (I like stainless steel)  I’ve found a couple of supposedly good/used ones on http://Expo.</description>

      <description>This fall will mark a decade for me at Microsoft. I spent sometime as a contractor and nine years as a full time employee so through that I’ve been a part of some pretty darn special moments. This morning though probably has and might go down as the biggest for me. Charles and I had the privilege to sit down with Bill and Steve for a brief interview on Channel 9 discussing Bill’s next steps and his plan to move to his foundation full time in 2008.</description>

For the Techies building teams — TechieManager.com (Hat tip: Kim Greenlee)
For those entering the startup land – StartupNation.com
I listened to Startup Nation Radio this past weekend on 770 AM in Seattle for the first time. Loved it, good practical advice especially their Elevator Pitch section. The show is also available via a Podcast. One of my favorite business programs though of all time is CBC’s Venture which goes behind the scenes in all types of businesses from startups, mom and pops and corporations.</description>

      <description>So if you’re following along on my wife’s blog you’ll already know that I’ve gotten back into skateboarding: Jeff got his skateboard this past Monday (I have some pics of him and Josie using it that he will have to put up later ..) and it took about 24 hours and she decided she just had to get one too. So, last night we took everyone to Redmond Town Center, including Brady The Dog, and walked around.</description>

      <description>A little over three years ago Robert became a close member of my family. Since then I consider myself one of the lucky to be able to work so closely with him and to watch him grow. Inch by inch he has grown from blogger to one of the voices of transparency for our company. There’s a lot of coverage out on the net about Robert’s new adventure, but I think Marc Orchant covered it best in his post by referencing Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s A Psalm of Life_.</description>

Great video on 10 today [that highlights some improvements][1] that will be coming in a future update to XBox Live.&amp;nbsp; I love my 360&amp;nbsp;but I had to major annoyances.
1. Not being able to&amp;nbsp;queue downloads. 2. Music that I&amp;#8217;d stream from my media center PC would stop when I&amp;#8217;d go in and out of games.
Both of these problems are fixed in this update. Awesome. Check it out here.</description>

You know, if you’re like me you hate the chore of packing for a conference making sure you have all the right sync cables, a charger for your phone, games for my PSP, music transferred to my music player. Do I really need all this stuff? It is only a 2 hour flight to Vegas from Seattle, but I really feel naked without my devices.</description>

      <description>Robert hinted recently on his blog that our team is working towards launching some new things. Its all really exciting and at the same time totaly exhausting. When in ship mode I find myself in a machine like state, focussing on lists and of course my “not so secret weapon” GTD in order to stay sane. You know what? It sort of works. 🙂 (That and adrenalin)
One of the great things about my team though is that everyone has an active blog.</description>

Nice! We added tags to Channel 9 last June and then to Microsoft Gadgets in December of 2005. The tagging implementation on gadgets is a bit more interesting as they are user generated tags and we also have a nifty tag search in our gallery with an intellisense like look up. Here’s an example search for RSS on the Microsoft Gadgets Gallery:</description>

Seriously, is this breaking news? 🙂
I remember when I was kid in Canada we’d brave -40 degree temperatures (-90 with wind chill!) just to have a snowball fight! Those temperatures meant that if you left skin exposed you would need medical attention. But here its windy so there is a breaking news alert? Ok, now I sound like one of those old chaps who had a harder life than you when they were kids.</description>

      <description>Guy writes a great piece on the art of building great communities. Lots of good advice. Reminds me of a piece I wrote sometime ago on my experience of building communities at Microsoft (something I’ve been doing for the last 9 years) When people ask how I do it, I respond, “Everything I learned about building communities I learnt tending bar“. 🙂
You can read my complete piece here, but here’s the key points:</description>

      <description>So this afternoon we bought Josie a new bike. Its called Rosie (that’s the model name 🙂 ) and is made by Electra Bikes. It has a very retro look / feel and is a breath of fresh air from the mass produced children’s bicycles you see at Target. Josie loves the bike and I find it soothing watching her ride something that looks right out of the 1950s. Very nostalgic.</description>

      <description>NBC is cancelling The West Wing. I haven’t watched it as much since it moved to Sundays, even though I do record it on my PVR. You know ever since Aaron Sorkin quit, it just has not packed the same punch. In fact the writing has seemed a tad schizophrenic at times.
Still sad to see it end, I had always hoped that they’d be able to at least run another season with a different President.</description>

      <description>My wife Lauri ran a pretty active online blogging / political forum for a number of years. It went from a small private community for a few friends to chat to one of the top political boards in the country. Last year on Mothers day as a gift to herself she shut it all down. In her words, it just wasn’t fun anymore. I’ve really missed reading her writing though and have asked on many occasions for her to start writing a personal blog.</description>

Now from Todd’s blog I read that Microsoft has purchased the buildings as part of a growing expansion plan for the campus. Todd writes:Some Microsoft employees appear to be in line for new digs. Safeco Corp.</description>

Do you have a dog?
Do you have a backyard?
Do you love your dog, but don’t like clean up after him?
Do you live in Seattle (Eastside too)
Then hire a pro! http://PooperTrooper.net is a Seattle based company that does all the work for you.</description>

      <description>Funny, Lauri and got back from Scoble and Shel’s book launch party and were watching TV. VH1 had a compilation show on called Web Junk 20. Video number 4 was Chris Pirillo and the famous butterfingers moment from Call for Help. If you want to watch the bit check it out on VSPOT online. You really feel for the guy showing off the antiques at the end.
Always weird seeing a friend on TV even if its Chris.</description>

      <description>This is probably the best description I have read of a PM yet. I spent many years at Microsoft as a PM in Visual Studio, MSDN and also in our Evangelism group. I’ve always equated the role as something like a cross between taskmaster and Mother Theresa.
Great post Chris.</description>

      <description>Paul reviews the Google Pack and his conclusion is:While virtually every computer company on earth is scared to death of Google, and virtually every PC user seems to be in love with them, Google Pack serves nicely as a reality check. Not only is Google human, buts the flaws in Google Pack suggest that this company has a long, long way to go before it can ever justify its insanely lofty stock price.</description>

      <description>Believe (turn your speakers up) by Brooks and Dunn is an absolutely amazing song and the video is even cooler video (sorry can’t find a link to view it online). The video is in regular rotation on VH1 Country. Over the holidays when the television wasn’t locked onto the XBOX 360 we had Lauri and I seemed to have VH1 Country Videos on most of the time. This Brooks and Dunn Believe song became one of my favorites, just so spiritual and moving.</description>

      <description>Man, Josie and I noticed over Christmas that Boomerang is now available via Comcast On Demand in our neighborhood. (On Demand -&amp;gt; Kids -&amp;gt; Boomerang). Boomerang has all those great classic cartoons (that used to be on Cartoon Network) like the Jetsons, Flintstones, Scooby Doo and more. Stuff I grew up on Saturday mornings or lunch time home from school (our local TV played Flintstones for years at noon)
So far Comcast hasn’t brought it on nationally as a channel, the DSL Reports Comcast Forums are saying that most areas now have it as On Demand, but only Atlanta (where Turner Broadcasting is based) gets Boomerang in its full channel 24/7 glory.</description>

 Turn down a big VC firm.
Randomly pick a super large VC firm, hit the about our people page, find the “associates”, and send one a letter declining to allow the firm to participate in your next fund raising. Make it all official like, use buzz words like synergy, web 2.0 personification, and mention that, “frankly that associate of yours really didn’t understand basics of recurring revenue on a recursive basis.</description>

I love my HDTV!

The hot link pro has gotten rave reviews out in the message boards.</description>

 Before
After
The Harmony 880 Advanced Universal Remote makes my home theater much easier to use as it combines the remotes for my XBox, Media Center PC, Plasma, Comcast HD DVR, Component Video Switchbox and Bose Lifestyle system into one remote. I’ve seen lots of universal remotes in the past but there are few things that make this one a buy in my house.</description>

I’ll let you know how it goes once its charged and I can setup some macros. The goal is here is to make it so my wife can just select Watch TV, Play Game or Watch Movie on the remote and it will automatically switch the plasma to the right setting, turn the cable box on and change the audio settings on my receiver.</description>

Hope to see you there…

      <description>Have you seen the cool application running inside the PDC? Its built on Avalon and combines session data, show announcements, Channel 9 videos aligned with the event and finally attendee photos. The data is consumed from RSS feeds that we created for the event.
Joe Smith and Ernie Booth are the folks behind the code of the application. Remember Vibe from the last PDC? This application in Avalon took the most popular used features from Vibe and is made available via the plasmas at the venue.</description>

      <description>Just noticed News.com now has a tag cloud. Kind of a cool user experience where as you type a tag name it shortens down the resultset. As we add more tags to Channel 9 we’ll probably have to do something like this.
Too bad they don’t have friendly URLs like http://channel9.msdn.com/tags/avalon and also they don’t include the rel=”tag” item to their links though.

      <description>Where have I been lately? Me and the team have been heads down getting an update to Channel 9 out the door.
I’m really excited about this update. We focused on making the site easier to use, simple to find things and also expand into other types of media types such as
Podcasts and Screencasts. My favorite part of all is our support for tags. In the spirit of Technorati, Flickr and Delicous we’re supporting tags.</description>

From my previous few discussions on MSN and Frameworks, you may have guessed that we have a client framework infrastructure. We are developing a framework to enable us to consistantly implement and integrate rich components. To demonstrate how the MSN Frameworks will enable us to innovate quickly – I built and shipped (beta quality 🙂 a new MSN Blog Map component within start.com. The MSN Blog Map maps bloggers from throughout MSN (expect the list to grow over the next few weeks).</description>

      <description>Congratulations to the folks at Konfabulator on being acquired by Yahoo! If you’ve never used it, give it a whirl (its now free) and the class act that they are, they are giving folks who bought Konfabulator 2.0 a refund. Now can someone please write a Flickr photoviewer like this for Konfabulator? Now that Yahoo! owns them (and since they also own Flickr) this seems like a no brainer.
_Update: John in my comments for this post explains that the standard Konfabulator photo frame widget does support Flickr.</description>

In an open letter to the fans of the show on his Web site, Jones says that “rather than honoring our legendary show, they have chosen to degrade it.</description>

      <description>I’m getting some heat by Ross Jones in the comments for my post about the MSN Screensaver that it requires the MSN Toolbar to function. Whilst I don’t want to rain on your parade isn’t putting functionality (search) on a screensaver fairly pointless? Do you tend to sit and try and use your computer when the screensaver is on? Personally the only time I ever see it is when I come back to my computer and press space to re-activate it.</description>

I never thought about integrating messenger buddy status and search into a screensaver. Feature Request: Allow me to publish photos from an MSN Spaces blog, that way I can install it on my mom and dad’s computer to share photos.</description>

After reading Soma’s blog about Turning Ideas into reality” and the image stitching in Acyrlic I played with it. “a cool photo-stitching feature in Microsoft Acrylic. Scanned images or photographs usually capture a limited amount of information, forcing us to take multiple scans/photos of a panoramic view or a large original image.Microsoft Acrylic provides one of the best image-stitching features by seamlessly combining multiple images. This feature was a direct result of our collaboration with MSR.</description>

What I absolutely love about our team is the lively debates we have about strategy, technology and our overall direction as a team and company. The amazing thing is no matter how spirited the discussion gets or how much might disagree about an item, we aways leave the discussion as friends and with mutual respect.</description>

Great way to give exposure to indy artists driving CD sales and also giving podcasters music for their podcasts.

      <description>I cut my teeth in .NET working with a fellow by the name of Garland Brown on a project where we wrapped Microsoft’s internal Siebel implementation as a web service.
.NET Undocument writes an interesting history of the road to Getting Web Services: The notion of “software as a service” has gradually become a coherent and unifying story throughout Microsoft. I see it in the .NET framework support for web services and ClickOnce, in Indigo’s attempts to unify the various Windows communications approaches into a simple, common services-based API, in Avalon’s borrowing of UI patterns (deployment, inductive UI, markup, navigation) from the Web.</description>

      <description>Sweet! Mike Hall fills us in on an awesome Power Toy for Windows Mobile. One of my frustrations with Windows Mobile is that sometimes I realize I want to send someone email via my Pocket PC, but don’t have their email address in my local contacts store on the device. If I only had access to my the Global Addreess Book stored on Exchange. Now I do. Awesome! 🙂 Microsoft Global Contact Accessis a free power toy for Windows Mobile devices which enables you to look up contacts in the Global Address List (GAL) and check co-worker schedules.</description>

      <description>We had a great offsite today for the Channel 9 Team. At Microsoft an offsite is a meeting where you take the team away from the normal settings and do some planning.
Offsites serve as a a great way to get everyone away from email, the daily routines and devote a solid day to planning. From my previous experience at offsites you never quite know what you’ll get out of an offsite.</description>

It would seem only right that if I am going to be spending my time thinking, dreaming and breathing all things Channel 9, then I should probably know how to code my way out of a paper bag.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, the truth is my passion for technology has never moved beyond pure consumption of said technologies.</description>

      <description>I’m thinking (I repeat thinking) about buying a new car and am looking for something fun. Recently while in California I noticed a new mustang that had some styling effects and alluminum wheels that made it really stand out.
Turns out the car was no ordinary Mustang, it was a Saleen Mustang. A company with a long heritage of crafting beautiful cars, what Saleen does to the Mustang GT is amazing.</description>

      <description>Robert talks about the great part last night at Eric Ewings, man what a blast! These have been going on for years and for me each time it serves as reunion of sorts. The conversations were all over the map (not just Microsoft talk) Doug Seven and I badgered Robert about how he is so wrong about the new Mustang. Kevin Briody and I talked about hosting some Blogger meetups on the Sammamish Plateau and Amy Sorakas and Doug’s wife talked about wakeboarding injuries.</description>

      <description>Today was a real fun day at work. Robert Scoble and I went over and interviewed Steve Ballmer for Channel 9. I’ve been in meetings with Steve in the past once or twice, but nothing like this. We filmed the video in Steve’s office on Microsoft campus, Robert did a great job interviewing him and Steve was definitely himself.
I don’t think we ever dreamt back in the day when we launched Channel 9 that we’d get Steve to do an interview.</description>

      <description>I’m thinking about making the move to HDTV, in preparation for the XBOX 360 but am left with confusion. My hope is to purchase a 42″ flat panel / plasma television to hang on the wall in our family room.
Questions…
 What is the difference between HDTV and HDTV ready? What is Extended Definition? (Sounds like some sort of imitation where the quality is poor?) Have you purchased one lately?</description>

      <description>Powerful blog post from Lenn:We have decided to consider making Tallinn home, but have a little more thinking to sort out. Watching a country with a great and deep history and culture emerge from 50 years of soviet occupation is something quite amazing to see. The people are smart, well educated, hard working, kind if not a bit distant. They are also stunningly beautiful as a whole. It is a unique place with a unique culture and a unique language reshaping itself in a new era.</description>

      <description>Found this little gem today [over on the Channel 9 Coffee House][1]:
A couple of other ex-MS employees and I have created a futuristic animation of Microsoft campus. Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) technology is a new transit technology under development and could be commercialized as soon as 2008. PRT is a “packet switched people mover,” faster than a car. Buildings 26-28, Troon, and Augusta were modeled for this animation, with PRT zooming around the buildings.</description>

      <description>Scoble started a list awhile back of why he is at Microsoft in response to Joel. For me its the people, the passion and the fact that despite some opinions of late we are getting stuff done.
Dean and the rest of “Microsoft’s Longhorn, Browing and RSS Team” (time for you to rename your blog) gave me yet another reason yesterday at Gnomedex. You can watch the video here on Channel 9.</description>

      <description>So I made a post the other night about something that Steve Cellini and the PDC Team had put in my office while I was on the road. I was asking if someone could take a picture. I wanted to see what it was before I returned and share it via my blog.
No one on my team would comply. I was more than slightly annoyed.
Good thing they didn’t listen to me 🙂 It would have given away the surprise.</description>

      <description>As I wrote earlier, I’m on the road with Sanjay visiting customers and connecting with our local Evangelists. It has been a great week so far, but quite intense. We’ve been packing a lot into each day. From reading Steve’s blog tonight, it looks like I’ve got a surprise waiting for me in my office.Also, today, a couple of us dragged what seemed to be a small yellow rectangular body / structure into Jeff’s office.</description>

It will be a whirlwind trip taking us from Chicago to Denver to San Diego to Santa Monica then home to Seattle. All beginning with a 6:10 am flight Monday morning. Nothing beats getting out on the road and meeting with customers and I am really excited to go on this trip.</description>

Awesome!

      <description>Just surfing through my aggregator tonight and noticed a post from Marc Canter where he includes a screenshot of a new tool that he’s building that he calls a micro-contentaggregator, that will render out all the microformats from all over the web.
Sort of reminds me of of the recently released  project. In addition to remembering my recent searches and having a clean user experience it aggregates all sorts of microcontent, ranging from astronomy pics of the day, scoble, engadget and more.</description>

      <description>Do you remember the excitement you felt as a child when you wrote your first simple program?
I do.
I started with a hangman style game on my Commodore 64 that was written in BASIC. Then it was on to application that helped me memorize french verbs, next a variation of Pacman followed and the last program written on my Commodore 64 was a Bulletin Board System that used Assembly Language for speed and Basic for ease of customization.</description>

I don’t care what your view of the war is, or your position on what we’re doing over there. There are plenty of places and times to argue those things. It’s just that scene has just been burning in my mind all day. I’ll never forget the sacrifice that these guys are making on my behalf.</description>

      <description>Robert just posted part 2 of our interview series with Rick LaPlante on VSTS to Channel 9.
In part 2 Rick talks about changes we’ve made to our pricing due to customer feedback, what changes in a product team when you’re getting ready to ship and I get to talk a little about our technology adoption programs.
Watch the video from part 2 here and part 1 is available here.</description>

      <description>Ok, this post is either going to label Lauri and I as parents that spoil their kids, but we’d just like to be known as fun. Anyhow, it was a major spoiling day today for Josie. I’ve included the play by play pictures so you can follow allong. This was fun 😉Big Box
Even gets FM!
Some assembly required…
Anxious spectators (safety first!)

      <description>Hey I was checking my referrers via Bloglines and found that the latest BradCast includes a little bit shout about me (references to Canada, Getting Things Done and of course my love of curling). You can listen to the specific portion here, (its short and cool). Thanks for the kind words Brad, you’re now on my Zen.
I feel Getting Things Done has made me effective, in fact I couldn’t imagine a world without it.</description>

Some of my favorite parts from this post:Further, I believe in the magic of software. We humans are a fascinating bunch. We’re pretty innovative. Yet of all the inventions we’ve created through the millenniums, I argue software is special.</description>

      <description>Lenn wrote a very nice post in the Channel 9 forums tonight talking about his departure. Lenn is a friend of mine, always will be and always some who I could count on. When times were rough or I was stressed beyond belief he was always just an instant message away. 🙂 We’ve spent our entire careers at Microsoft working beside on another, he called me his execution guy and we fed off of each other.</description>

      <description>Hey with all the changes going on and the Channel 9 Team coming back over to my group I bet many of you want to join in the fun! Yup, you heard right our team is growing and I’ve got a couple of open positions to fill.
In my opinion the Developer and Platform Evangelism Group is the only place to work in Microsoft. If you’re already employed at Microsoft and are even considering making a career change_,_ take a peak at the positions I have available below, and if one of them is your dream job send me a note and we should get together for a quick informational.</description>

      <description>Lenn announced today on his weblog that he was leaving Microsoft and Robert added to the fun to say that the team is moving over to my group. I’m really excited about working with Bryn, Charles, Robert, Ivan and Eric again. They will join my existing Evangelism team that Evangelizes the gospel of Avalon, Whidbey and the CLR. I’m sad to see Lenn go, we’ve worked together for basically his entire career at Microsoft and we learnt a lot from one another.</description>

      <description>Recently while reading a hometown newspaper I stumbled across the painting to the right of the school I attended as a child. This painting by Gail Frasz brings back great memories of the small farming community of Benson where I grew up and went to school. I think the population back then was around 100 people.
I spent most of my free time riding dirt bikes in the summer, snowmobiles in the winter and my horse Flash the rest of the time.</description>

He would have asked you for ten cents admission and introduced you to his fantasy world carved out of stone.

      <description>Internet Anxiety Disorder –Hat tip to Slashdot.orgWe live in an always on, ever connected world. My phone, wireless and wired rings constantly, and missed calls and voice mails pile-up even before the coffee stops brewing early in the morning. There are tips from sources, a friend on east coast on his way to work wanting to recap the Yankees game, and an occasional message of concern from mom! Time to boot up the computer and be greeted by an early morning assault of emails, sometimes as many as 100, and that’s before Sun’s first rays caress the Coit Tower.</description>

I remember the moment we got Slashdotted and wondering would we scale? (We did with ease)
I remember Rob Howard calling me and saying, “Wow you shipped on a beta of community server.. Awesome”
I remember thinking that hey it would be cool if we had a Wiki (3 days before launch) and Bryn made it so</description>

Day 1: We opened our public video upload service today. Huge uptake. Terabytes of data uploaded in less than 24 hours. Thankfully the truth about why we’re offering this “service” never got out…
Day 3: Began feeding the videos into The Computer today.</description>

In doing this most RSS aggregators probably think that all my items have changed because the guids are now different. Sorry about that, but I think its worth the change. My old links will continue to work.</description>

      <description>Awhile back Lenn and I were talking about how far we’ve came from a mobility perspective and I guess a bit about how far we have to go. This got me thinking about the variety of tools I’ve used to keep connected over the years, how they’ve evolved, improved and the drastic improvements.

Once they get what they want they begin to sing, “Dad is great, he gives us chocolate cake.” Bill’s feeling all good until his wife comes down and gives him a dirty look.</description>

I want to create a link blog that only contains individual podcasts that I find interesting. Subscribing to the RSS feed for this podcast link blog wouldn’t return every Daily Source Code or Morning Coffee notes, just the individual shows I’ve found interesting. (Along with appropriate meta data to the creater,etc)
I need an easy way to generate an RSS feed of these posts and preserve the original enclosure so the RSS feed will work in podcatching software.</description>

      <description>There’s another pair of white headphones in Redmond. I picked up a new music device this past week. You know, I’ve struggled with which is the right device after busting my iPod back in October. I almost bought an Iriver H10 while on vacation, but didn’t make it back the store. I came home empty handed.
Omar’s review of the Zen Micro is what pushed me over the edge. I picked one up this week and once again I’ve got portable music!</description>

I’ll be honest, growing up in Canada I always wanted to have the American College experience so I’m just a bit jealous. There’s something magical about the American state colleges, football and Greek life.
Brynn is home this week for spring and is sitting her with me in the living room on her laptop.</description>

      <description>Ok, the feedback has been good so far on my moustache decision. Some folks have said they thought I was in my 40s when I had my moustache and a few others have told me I now look like Steve jobs. Believe it or not a turtle neck, blue jeans and tennis shoes have for a long time been my favorite clothes.
 Do you think there is a resemblance? My wife thinks not at all.</description>

      <description>You spoke and I listened. Thanks for all your feedback on my moustache decision. Thanks Dave, Robert, Don and Rex for the flow which led to a lot of great comments. Thank you all!
Tonight I said goodbye to the moustache, something I’ve held onto since I was 16 years old. I’ll turn 35 on June 29th of this year which means almost 20 years of this…

You see for almost the last twenty years I’ve had a moustache. Guys all know how it is, it seems through your younger years you’re trying to grow facial hair but then when you finally get it your cursing how much of a pain it is to maintain.</description>

      <description>Someone who I respect a lot recently came back from an extedned vacation. His return reminded me of an approach that he once mentioned to me about managing work life balance. He talked of the 5 F’s of life and how you should plan goals around these, measure progress and do a review just like you would for the most important project at work.
Lauri and I started doing this last year, we set goals around the 5 F’s, mapping out one year, five years and ten years.</description>

So I found these wonderfully tasty things on the floor next to Dad’s night stand. Hey if they are on the floor, they are fair game right?</description>

      <description>As of Wednesday this week, I reach quite the milestone. Wednesday is my final appointment with my trainer for the 20/20 Program. The program is broken into a phase 1 (I call it boot camp :-)) and phase 2 which is maintenance.
In phase 1, I went from 205 pounds to 157 pounds. I did drop a fair amount of weight before starting the program, nonetheless worked my butt off through phase 1 getting myself down to my ideal body weight in time for phase 2.</description>

On the shelf were a number of books from my childhood by Doctor Seuss and the Berenstains. There is something quite soothing turning the pages of a book that was read to you as a child to your own children.</description>

It is an amazing tribute, being able to touch pieces of steel taken from rubble of the twin towers was moving, seeing pieces of the planes that struck the towers left me lost for words and watching a video that pieced together the news events from that day brought tears to the eyes of many including myself.</description>

      <description>In honor of Superbowl Sunday, MSN Search has updated their background image. 
I’m finding that I am using MSN Search more and more ever since they launched the beta. In fact MSN Search is now my Internet Explorer home page.
One of my peeves with Google is trying to search for a phone number for a hotel. Google seems to return me everything *but* the official hotel site. I ran into this tonight, you see my parents are down in Palm Springs for the winter and I wanted to get the number to the resort where they are staying.</description>

Photographs and moving images capture moments from the attack, and visitors confront powerful artifacts including twisted steel from the World Trade Center, damaged items from the Pentagon, memorials from the crash site in Pennsylvania, clothing worn by survivors, and objects used by rescue workers and public officials.</description>

GTD has helped me stay sane and manage the volumes of information I get each day. Last week David came and spoke to our organization at Microsoft.
Even though I’ve attended David’s seminar and consider myself on my way to be a GTD blackbelt 🙂 I still picked up a number of tips and continue to refine how I use the system.</description>

When we last left you the advice we had gotten from the surgeon was that, “It may or not get better in the next couple of years, we’ll have to wait and see”. We took this advice back to Josie’s primary physician and he was dissapointed, actually visibly troubled. He couldn’t believe no X-Rays were taken or that certain specific tests weren’t completed.</description>

      <description>Josie’s favorite Joke..
Bob the duck walks into a feed store and asks the guy at the counter, “Got any fish?”
The guy at the counter responds, “Sorry, we don’t, we only sell feed.”
Bob the duck thanks the man and leaves the store.
The next day Bob returns to the feed store and asks again, “Got any fish?”
The guy at the counter responds, “As I told you yesterday, we don’t sell fish, we sell feed.</description>

For the last 36 hours we’ve been through a bit of turmoil in our little family. For those of you who know me or those who don’t but follow my blog, I talk endless about Josie our 5 year old little girl. My wife sums up Josie’s personality with the following sentence, “Josie is Jeff in a dress!</description>

      <description>Robert talks about Technorati and Dare mentions in Robert’s comments that he’s seen a degradation in the Technorati Service.
I’ve used Techorati since the beginning and even promoted it on stage at a variety of events. Lately though I can’t trust the results as much as I used to. The just don’t appear to be as consistent. In fact I get very different results from all the blog search services that I check.</description>

      <description>My Windows XP Media Center is located in an entertainment center and hidden away from view. It runs 99 per cent of the time with the 10’ User Experience that I control via my remote control. In order to ensure that machine is always running in the 10’ User Experience it is configured to automatically logon using the Windows XP Tweak UI Power Toy upon boot. This works well, but if I connect to the mahine via a remote desktop connection and then logoff, it leaves the computer with a Windows XP logon dialog.</description>

      <description>Has anyone gotten Skype 1.1 to install? I’m building out this laptop while writing a tutorial on how to Podcast on XP and Skype setup won’t run. The process just hangs. It looks like other users are encountering the same problem.
Any suggestions?
Postscript: Omar came up with a solution in my comments that worked. To install Skype 1.1 I had to boot XP into safe mode (without networking support) Here are the steps you need to take:</description>

      <description>From Microsoft Partners with Tivo:Microsoft Chairman and Founder Bill Gates announced during his keynote address tonight at the Consumer Electronics Show that the two companies have embarked on a collaborative effort designed to allow consumers to take digital entertainment with them on portable devices.

      <description>Tivo today released the TivoToGo feature that allows Tivo users to transfer television programs from their Tivo to a computer. When a solution from Sonic ships you will also be able to burn the transfered programs to DVD via the PC. For more information I recommend this post on the TivoCommunity.com forum. If you’re interested in playing with this feature and don’t have a Tivo, I’ve still got one left for sale after deciding to turn off my Tivo.</description>

      <description>I heard about the keyboard organizer last night and it was one of those “Why didn’t I think of that ideas?”
I love a clean desk, I can’t think with lots of clutter, but there always seems to be a CD, a notepad or a pencil laying around. This here wold be the answer for me.
Unfortunately though it will not work for me as I use my Sony VAIO as my desktop machine by connecting a monitor to it and a keyboard/mouse via Bluetooth.</description>

      <description>I had mentioned previously that I looked forward to Dino Rossi possibly taking on Maria Cantwell in ‘06. With some of the recent discoveries I don’t expect Dino to concede any time soon now.
Check out the following from Sound Politics:
 It was last reported that there were 3,539 more ballots counted in King County than voters who cast them. The discrepancy is actually much larger. The 3,539 is only the net.</description>

      <description>Found this gem on Jim Grisanzio’s weblog…_I hate multitasking. Absolutely despise it. Always have. I’ve poked fun at this idiotic notion of multitasking here, here, and here, too. And I try to ignore — or at least placate — people who tell me I should multitask more (as if I’m not forced to multitask enough already). Instead, I’m making a major effort to narrow my activities and focus focus focus. The more I do this the more relaxed I become and the more successful I feel.</description>

      <description>I get asked all the time now that I’ve completed the first phase of 20/20 if I miss food? My answer, not at all, in fact I love it now more than I ever. The only difference is I can taste it because its not loaded up with sauces. I recently discovered a great show on the Food Network called the Calorie Commando.
 Meet Juan-Carlos Cruz, The Calorie Commando. Juan-Carlos believes that it is possible to eat heart-healthy without feeling deprived.</description>

      <description>I’ve got the AudioVox that Scoble talks about continously and am fortunate to also have the XDA III. I prefer the XDA III over the Audiovox. The slide out keyboard makes it great for doing mail and its killer to have built in 802.11 support. After years of syncing a phone or putting up with slow GPRS, its empowering to use a Pocket PC on a high speed LAN.
The Audiovox is a great phone and a great pric, but the screen is too small for my daily usage and I’ve never gotten used to typing fast using the keypad.</description>

      <description>Here’s my last thought on the election in Washington State. If it is not obvious, I’m a big fan of Rossi. I love his pro-business outlook and what he did to keep this state from a distasterous California like budget shortfall through crafting of a miracle budget.
As chairman of the Senate Ways and Means Committee, he drove around the state on a trip in which he tried to fashion a consensus of Republicans and Democrats on a budget that didn’t raise taxes and preserved programs for the elderly and developmentally disabled.</description>

 TiVo, listen up and listen good: these things have dual tuners (don&amp;rsquo;t even try and tell us it&amp;rsquo;s not necessary), they record HDTV, rock HD video on demand, and still do 60 hours of regular TV. And they cost the consumer nothing but an extra $10 per month.  I loved my Tivo before getting the Comcast box. I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest I would not want a Comcast box without the Microsoft software so phone Comcast and say I want my Microsoft powered DVR!</description>

      <description>On the radio tonight I heard a story that many absentee votes from our troops overseas were not counted in the Washington State Governor election. This is a slap in the face for folks who’ve volunteered to fight for our freedom around the globe.
If you have a moment please take the time and call the Washignton Secretary of State Sam Reed at 360–902–4151. Let him know that we need to count these military ballots as well.</description>

Given that the PDC has always been run out of his org, “assigned” is probably a better word than “volunteered”, but Vic is a gracious guy and he used “volunteered”.</description>

      <description>I changed from Cingular to T-Mobile this last week and kept my phone number. It was easy and it worked!
Here’s all I had to do:
 Let my service contract for Cingular end so I could move on. I called T-Mobile and told them my Cingular phone number and Cingular Account Number T-Mobile sent me a new SIM chip (I have an XDA II phone that is unlocked so all I needed was the chip) Replaced the Cingular SIM chip in my phone with T-Mobile and it worked with my original phone number.</description>

      <description>Yes, Nicole I am planning to do a Podcast. Right now, I’m building out the site for the show, trying to understand the best way to set it all up and learning how to produce such a beast.
I’m creating the show with Adobe Audition on Windows XP. I was pleasantly surprised to find that Audition comes with a number of royalty free sound clips and is also easy to use.</description>

      <description>Major Nelson has also unplugged his Tivo. I unplugged mine last week and couldn’t be happier with the product, Scoble did the same last week on my advice. Harry Pierson gets his installed today.
Major Nelson gives some of the reasons why I am so happy to have my Tivo gone…
 Your IR blasters often mis-fired and caused you to recorded “Oprah” when I wanted to record a James Bond movie.</description>

      <description>I’ve turned off my Tivo, I no longer need it. Its been a great product that I’ve evangelized to friends, family and co-workers. I no longer need it though as I’ve replaced it with a new PVR that Comcast just brought onto the market.
It is a great unit and my the wife acceptance factor was high. (she’s using it now and totally gets how to use it).
You can watch a video here of the user experience or geek out on the AVSForum for more detailed information.</description>

      <description>Friday (yesterday) marked the beginning of week 6 for me and the 20/20 Program at the Pro Sports Club. I’m now down to 172 pounds and have been losing weight at the rate of 2 to 3 pounds per week. I did lose about 10 pounds before actually beginning the program.
Yesterday, was a breakthrough day. I participated in a Spinning Class with my trainer. Spinning is something I have always wanted to try and had hoped to do by the end of the program.</description>

      <description>Now we wait for Kerry to give his concession speech or the armies lawyers to descend upon Ohio. My Wife and I believe President Bush won tonight, but I am sure others feel Kerry still has a chance to win.
Moments ago I hung our American flag proudly out in front of our home. This was the flag our family purchased on the afternoon of September 11, 2001. It is the first American flag I’ve ever owned, as I am originally from Canada.</description>

      <description>I can’t vote tomorrow because I’m Canadian, but here’s some good advice from the folks over at Electoral Vote Predictor 2004
Read carefully. Your vote could decide this election.   Find out today where your polling place is by calling your county clerk or checking www.mypollingplace.com  Alternatively, call 1-866-MYVOTE1 to find your polling place.  Check the hours the polls are open with your city or county clerk.  Print the League of Women Voters&amp;#8217; card in English or Spanish and put it in your wallet or purse.</description>

      <description>News.com: George W. Bush is heading for a surprise landslide victory in next week’s presidential elections, going by online betting patterns.
This article is based on what Betfair.com is disclosing on wagers they have received on the election. Their figures show 2.3 million pounds ($4.2 million) have been wagered on Bush, while Kerry has attracted only 680,000 pounds ($1.25 million) in bets. The Betfair.com folks say that Bush is now at 1-5 odds to stay in office, whereas gamblers can still get odds of 2-1 on Kerry to win.</description>

      <description>Today marks the beginning of week 5 for me and the 20/20 program. An amazing change is taking place in my life.
When I first started the program my trainer had the tension level on the ellipticals set to 3 and this was the most I could do. My heart rate would quickly rise to over 160 and I’d tire out quickly.
Last night was quite a different story, we had the tension level set to 8 and my heart rate was at 155.</description>

      <description>XM Radio – Delphi MyFi™
This looks kind of cool, but a bit pricey. I’d definitely look at replacing my Roady with this since it can be used in the car via an FM Modulator or Tape Adapter then used for jogging. The cool thing is its like a Tivo in a way because you can store up to 5 hours of programming on the internal storage. This can be recorded on the fly or even scheduled.</description>

 Hello all. You are probably wondering why I am posting in the Journal area. Well, for starters because I can! But really, it&amp;#8217;s to say &amp;#8220;Hi&amp;#8221; and let you know that I&amp;#8217;m the poor soul who&amp;#8217;s been working on finishing up the Windows version of Konfabulator.

      <description>More fun trying to cancel my Audible.com account this afternoon. To see how this started in part 1 of this saga.
I called their 1-800 number at around 3:05 PM and after waiting on hold (listening to an audio book they had for background music) at 3:30 I got a represenative who verified who I was and asked what I wanted to do.
When I told her that I wanted to cancel she put me back on hold and said she’d have to transfer for me to someone else.</description>

      <description>I ran into the same problem that Jerermy Zawodny and a few others did as well. There is no way on the Audible.com web site to cancel your subscription. *sigh*
To cancel the Audible subscription, I had to:
 Search and search their site for where to cancel and opt out Send a customer service request to ask how I got an email back saying they need me to call a number Wait on hold (still on hold now)  Goodbye Audible, I’ll never be back.</description>

      <description>While watching a recording of Wing Nuts today it opened with an “in memory of screen” for one of the folks on the show, Tim Roberts. Sadly, Tim passed away on October 11th.
This is the second passing for a person on a reality show on Discovery Channel that I watch. Michael Tata an executive at Green Valley ranch on Discovery’s American Casino passed away last spring.
Sad, both young folks were talented in their own ways and at very exciting times in their lives.</description>

As of yesterday I am now at 185 pounds and feeling great! That is an eighteen pound drop in weight and am continue to lose it at an average of 2.</description>

      <description>Check out here. Its cool (I signed up to give it a try) unfortunately it won’t have all the channels I enjoy, they don’t include all the talk networks that I like so much *sigh*, certainly not a replacement for the now infamous PCR that is no longer available.</description>

      <description>Dang it. I was loading up my gym bag last night and my iPod fell to the floor. It landed with a thud on the hardwood floors in my kitchen with a large thud. I packed in my bag thinking that it would be fine. It wasn’t all right, its dead. Its now a great paper weight just displaying a folder with an explanation mark on it. 🙁
So am I off to the Apple store to replace it with a new one?</description>

      <description>Scoble and so many others have been blogging lately about Podcasting. I am a super fan of this, if you are not yet, I encourage you to do this:
Burn a few Podcasts to a portable device or even a blank CD and take them with you for a drive, its great content and fun.
One thing though I think Scoble is confusing folks when he calls things great for Podcasting.</description>

      <description>This is part 2 of my series on getting a handle on your email inbox. In part 1, I talked discussed David Allen’s Getting Things Done Methodology. I can’t emphasize his approach enough, he has help me and many friends clear our phsycic ram and get things done.
In this part I won’t focus as much on Getting Things Done, but on explaining how I use Outlook Rules, Folder Heirarchy and Custom Folders Views to manage projects and eliminate inbox hell.</description>

      <description>I get a lot of mail and wanted to share how I manage the large volumes of email, tasks and information that I get while working at Microsoft. I use a variety of tools to help me incorporate David Allen’s getting things done methodolgy (GTD) and they work really well for me. As more and more folks come to me and ask me about information management it was time to create something permanent “that scales” as we say at Microsoft so I can share the knowledge.</description>

      <description>What an amazing week!
I’ve made it through the first 7 days of the 20/20 program. The past week has been full of big changes for me. The first part is the diet change which has been hard but not impossible. I met with my dietician and she gave me a bunch of vitamins and minerals (fish oil caplets, calcium and daily multi vitamins), a log book to record eactly what I eat each day, the calories and the total fat.</description>

      <description>I’m seriosuly thinking about adding a Podcast to the mix here, probably won’t be a daily show do to time commitments, but it will be at least weekly (on Saturdays). Just trying to see if I’ll make it solo or get someone to join in the party. The question remains will it just be rambling or be focused on some particular topic.
I think I’ve just about got the setup configured on my PC, just a couple of more things to test.</description>

Postscript: It download sucessfully the Adam Curry’s daily source code and Evil Genius Chronicles adding them to iTunes. It did eventually crash, but for alpha this is cool.

      <description>I am starting my eighth year at Microsoft and although this last year was chalk full of amazing experiences, building Channel 9, it was time for some changes.
For those that don’t know me I started at Microsoft in PSS supporting Visual InterDev 1.0 and Active Server Pages 1.0. I did that for about two years and went on to work in Visual Studio / MSDN. I worked in this group as a Program Manager building sites like Code Center and Lighthouse which was a service for the Visual Studio Shell that provided up to date data from MSDN to the shell.</description>

      <description>While on vacation this summer and doing some work around the house, I did not have the energy I used to have. Carrying furniture around and moving things up and down stairs made me sweat like a pig. I’d lose my breath and got tired needing a break before the job was done. To think I used to race BMX and ride motocross, where did it go?
Up until the the last few years I could eat lots of anything and my metabolism would make it go away.</description>

      <description>Watched the debate tonight with family. My mom and dad also watched as they are down visiting from Canada.
I’m searching the Blogosphere to see who people think the winner of the debate was. So far I see the left and right both calling out their respective candidate as the winner.
The election will be decided for the most part by the undecided voter, so I am more interested in hearing who the undecided voter thought one the debate tonight.</description>

      <description>AP – Small earthquakes rattled Mount St. Helens at the rate of one or two a minute Monday, and seismologists were working to determine the significance of some of the most intense seismic activity in nearly 20 years.
Lots happening at work and at home the last couple of weeks (all good), I’ll post some news talking all about what’s going on in the next day or so.</description>

      <description>Josie, Lauri and I went to the Farm Aid Concert in at the White River Ampitheater last night. This was Josie’s first major concert. This is the 19th Farm Aid Concert. I’ve watched them on television ever since I can remember. think Lauri and I started donating to Farm Aid shortly after we moved to the United States from Canada. My grandfather farmed and I have great memories being out on the farm with him during harvest.</description>

Willie Nelson, John Mellencamp, Dave Matthews, Neil Young and many other artists will be performing to help support the family farm. Its not about the music though folks though, its about helping preserve a way of life in America, the family farm.</description>

      <description>I was bummed when the XM PCR was taken off the market. I wanted to use it to broadcast XM Radio throughout my home over my network. I had no desire to break the law and rip music with the recording software that caused its early demise. I just wanted a way to broadcast tunes throughout my home and control it through my computer.
Today XM announced that they will ship XM Radio Online and because I already subscribe to their Satellite service I can join in the phone $3.</description>

Russell Beatie is producing Foo TV which has some cool videos. I admit its been a long time since I’ve slept in a tent, but I slept really well last night and awoke this morning to kids running around playing with a frisbee, folks wandering around looking for coffee.</description>

      <description>I’m spending the weekend up in Sebastopol, California for a private event. Driving up from San Francisco this afternoon I stumbled across the Glenn Beck radio program. Glenn was talking about how he dreamt for the day that 9/10 would return. You know all of us remember where we were on 9/11, but I am not sure if we all remember where we were on 9/10.
Glenn played a very touching audio compilation of radio programs, aircraft tower transmissions and other coverage from the day.</description>

  That slope-shouldered farm boy you are snickering at did more work before breakfast than you will do all week at the gym.
  It’s called a “gravel road.” No matter how slow you drive, you’re going to get dust on your BMW.</description>

Your download speed : 2979006 bps, or 2909 kbps.
A 363.6 KB/sec transfer rate.
Your upload speed : 239374 bps, or 233 kbps.
It is too bad (although understandable) that they restrict upload speeds as I’d probably look at putting my externally hosted sites in my home. I wonder how far we are away from the personal server at home for serving up web pages, weblogs and other content.</description>

      <description>I’ve removed my referrers from public view. The referrer spam just got out of control and I do not want to give these sites any free advertising or Google juice. This sucks as dasBlog has a very cool feature that would email me whenever someone pointed to something on my weblog, but now its been infiltrated with disgusting websites that I do not care to promote.
While Googling for a solution to the problem I found a number of automated tools for spaming weblogs, but no whitelists or solutions.</description>

      <description>Recently while reading Russell Beattie’s Weblog on the AT&amp;amp;T You Will commercials I found one of my favorites commercial spots.Watch the commercial (Quicktime Required)
The part where the little girl asks, “When can I become a client?” just pulls at your heart strings. I think balance is pretty mythical, sometimes you’ll have balance and other times you won’t. I think you just got to try and not forget the folks that are most important to you even when life gets crazy.</description>

      <description>Reading Dave’s post about staying in Banff tonight brings back greatchildhood memories as I spent a good part of my early childhood in Kamloops, British Columbia moving to Saskatchewan in the fifth grade.
Each summer our family would make the trip back to Saskatchewan for vacation which was at least a two day trip. Banff was the perfect spot to pull over and get out of the car to take a break.</description>

      <description>From News.com
 Since XM discontinued the PCR, units have fetched steep premiums on eBay. The device, which retailed for about $50, is getting bids of more than $350 in recent auctions, with sellers advertising the unit as &amp;#8220;discontinued&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;rare.&amp;#8221;  Looks like I missed the boat on this one.&amp;nbsp;I was just telling Lenn last week how I was going to snag one of the PCR units up. I think he was going to get one too.</description>

      <description>I am really looking forward to playing Fable for the Xbox. Based on the team’s webcam, it went gold this past week.The XBox site
describes Fable like this:
Fable™ is a ground-breaking role-playing adventure game from Peter Molyneux, in which your every action determines your skills, appearance, and reputation.
Create your life story from childhood to death. Grow from an inexperienced adolescent into the most powerful being in the world. Choose the path of righteousness or dedicate your life to evil.</description>

      <description>Dave Winer writes:Looks like the next stop will be Winnipeg, then across Saskatchewan, Alberta, into Vancouver and back into the US near Seattle.  If you are willing to steer of off the trans-Canada a couple of hours you can stop by my hometown of
Estevan, Saskatchewan, Canada. Your timing is perfect for a visit to Saskatchewan as the harvest should be in full swing. Make sure you pull over once or twice to ask the farmers in the field how the crops are doing.</description>

      <description>From [XM 411][1]:
The space at the top right now has three buttons; PAUSE, BACK and FORWARD. These are what control the 30 minute replay feature. The SKYFi2 constantly records the last 30 minutes of whatever you listened to, regardless of your changing the channel. One thing to note is that this 30 minute memory gets wiped out every time the unit is turned off. Pressing the BACK button will take you back one event (song change) at a time.</description>

      <description>We’re off to the Seattle Boat Show Today to look at a few boats and most importantly Josie wants to see Twiggy the Water skiing Squirrel. I’ll try and snap a few pictures of Twiggy today. We’re looking for a cruiser to use in Lake Washington and also for occasional trips to the San Juans. No plans to buy one today, just looking.
The saying goes something like, “The two happiest days in a boat owners life are The Day they bought it and the day the sold it.</description>

This is so cool, it reminded me of my first year at Microsoft back in late 1996. I had just started on the Active Server Pages 1.0 Developer Support Team in PSS. Our team was newly formed and if I had to guess about 90 per cent us had just moved to Redmond.</description>

I am not sure what I can offer in exchange, but you will get the pleasure of seeing how bad I am at this game. My gamertag is JeffSand if you’re up for a few games this weekend of tennis.</description>

      <description>We’re back from taking Brynn off for her freshman year at WSU. She’s all settled in and ready to experience campus life. The Pullman area reminded me of the farming community where I grew up, Estevan, Saskatchewan. Here’s a snapshot I took on the road home, just outside of Pullman.There is nothing quite as soothing as a warm summer night on the prairies, the smell of freshly harvested wheat and the open road.</description>

      <description>It day two of getting Brynn all setup at Washington State University. I am very impressed with how the University practices safe computing. In order to get Brynn’s computer onto the university network, the Resident Assistant came in with a disk which had all the latest patches for Windows XP and complimentary anti-virus software. She had a screenshot of the add/remove programs user interface too to make sure that all the required patches were installed to do a quick compare.</description>

      <description>Greetings from Lewiston, Idaho (about 20 minutes southeast of Pullman, WA). We spent the morning driving to Pullman and getting Brynn settled in at the university residence.
As I watched all the kids unload boxes with their parents it was definitely a who’s who of the electronics business. Televisions, DVDs players, XBoxes and Playstation 2’s were in abundance.
Brynn lucked out and her dorm is wireless which is pretty cool. We got a hotel down in Lewiston and it has free wi-fi throughout.</description>

      <description>We’re driving to Pullman, WA today. Our oldest daughter has been accepted into Washington State University. Today, we’ll get her checked into her dorm room and spend a day or two in the area. The great thing about being on an un-vacation is that I am not sure when we’ll be back, it might be tomorrow, it could be the next day, who knows? Let’s see where the wind blows us.</description>

      <description>I just noticed that BlogJet (a weblog editor I am playing with) has built in support for audio blogs. I am going to try it with this post and see if I can be cool like Dave and Adam. This assumes that adding audio to your Blog makes you cool 😉
Update: It worked! It captured my voice (time to get a microphone) and automatically streamed it to my Dasblog powered weblog.</description>

      <description>I’m playing with BlogJet today. So far the biggest benefit is that it makes it very easy for me to include local images with my posts. I just insert the image file with the WYSIWYG editor and browse for the local copy of the image. BlogJet takes it from there and automatically transfers the file to my server and creates the correct path to the image in the HTML for my post.</description>

Today was a fun start as the bunkbeds we ordered for our youngest daughter arrived. I had the pleasure of setting them up while she waited “patiently“ for me to complete the job.</description>

One of the coolest programs Jordan wrote back in the day (high school) was a modern day equivalent of Orkut.</description>

      <description>Dave writes:There’s something missing from Windows. An application that hooks into the outbound Internet message flow, and shows me where messages are going. This would allow me to figure out what spyware is running on my system even if the various utilities can’t get rid of them. Then the next step would be to allow me to block traffic to certain servers. That would disable the spyware. It seems that I should have control of my machine at that level.</description>

      <description>I caught a segment on Fox News about people blogging the DNC tonight. They explained what blogging is and contrasted how we get information in today’s news on demand world from back when JFK was nominated. Back then people waiting to get their papers delivered the next day to know who won the nomination. The piece did include a brief back and forth with David Weinberger.
So what does this have to do with Scoble?</description>

      <description>Fascinating how this famous cartoon from The New Yorker cartoon is proving less true as more and more folks get Weblogs. Weblogs give us an insider view of corporations and let us learn more about the individuals. Could the day arrive when we know for sure if you’re a dog or not? 😉</description>

      <description>Oh I am so playing with this application at the next conference I go to. This is pretty neat, I had heard of the mac version before (EtherPeg), but just stumbled across EtherWatch tonight for Windows.
The application shows you what’s happening on your network like:
 Google Search terms  Images from Websites  Packet Data Here’s a screenshot of it from the vendor’s site.        I&amp;amp;#8217;ve got it running in our home now and can see what my wife and daughters are viewing over the Net.</description>

      <description>I am liking my XM Radio, I love listening to the comedy stations and also the 70’s, 80’s and 90’s Channels on my commute. I never realized how many commercials local radio had until I got XM. Sure XM has commercials on some channels, but nothing like regular radio does.
It looks like XM Radio uses XML in their backend too. Just the other day while listening to the 80’s channel I had quite the surprise when I looked at the head unit.</description>

      <description>From Seattle Weekly:NASCAR—the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (no, it doesn’t stand for Non-Athletic Sport Centered Around Rednecks) is also, increasingly, Northwestern. By Christmas, the Daytona, Fla.–based International Speedway Corp. (ISC) hopes to announce its new Seattle-area NASCAR racetrack site, in either Snohomish, Kitsap, or Thurston counties.  Please let this be true! I love 4 wheel racing and dream of the day when I can visit Daytona. I’ve never been to an event, but would never miss a race if it was local.</description>

      <description>I found this gem tonight via Rick Brewster:Paint.NET is a senior design project aided by a mentor at Microsoft. It is a paint program designed entirely by students and written using Microsoft’s .NET Framework. The program makes it easier to create and edit photos. It maintains some of the best features of the original MS-Paint application and includes new, powerful tools. Such new tools include a history storage for undos and redos, and powerful multi-layering which is often seen only in high-quality, expensive photo-applications.</description>

Betsy’s recent post “What makes it a community” made me think about my own experiences running communities and the approach that I like to take.
Community has been part of my life for the past 20 years. My first experience was with a homebrew Bulletin Board called The Nutwork that ran on my Commodore 64 out my parent’s basement. This board ran faithfully on my Commodore 64 and eventually ended up running on my Amiga.</description>

Its all about interaction. If you don’t interact via comments and with the greater Blogosphere you’ve only got a press release.</description>

      <description>It has been a little over seven days since our team launched Channel 9. I’ve had some instant message and email conversations with Customers and Microsoft employees on our use of RSS with Channel 9. I need to write some help on this for the site as I don’t think its clear as to how deep you can go with RSS on our site. I’ll start first with this weblog entry and eventually I’ll move this post into a help file for the site.</description>

      <description>Today I had the great fortune to see an amazing presentation by Mike Schlappi, who tells an incredible personal story of how he overcame a tragic shooting accident to live an amazing life and gain 3 olympic medals.
I love these types of talks, makes me realize how lucky I’ve been in my life and how there’s no excuses to push hard and dream big.
A friend of mine, originally from my home province of Saskatchewan does a similar talk that Mike does, his name is Alvin Law.</description>

      <description>Lots of good feedback from my recent post on how I evaluate software. Marc and Buzz add to the discussion as well. On Marc’s weblog there is an especially good comment from Hal Rottenberg where he adds some more rules:
The Five-Minute Rule:
“If software breaks within the first 5 minutes of install or usage, TOSS IT.”
The One-Day Rule:
“Use a new piece of software for a day. When I wake up in the morning, if I am not moved to continue using it, or if I am having difficulty using or configuring it, uninstall it.</description>

      <description>Tonight Scoble mentioned, my seven day rule for evaluating software and I figured I’d explain a bit more about my short attention span for new applications. I love to try out new software all the time, in fact its sort of an obsession. I’m always on the prowl for cool new applications. After seven days of use though if I’m not totally blowon away or if its not improving my PC life, its straight to add/remove programs I go.</description>

**1. What was the last song you heard?
** The theme song from the kid’s show called Arthur me and my little one were cosied up in my lazyboy, spending some quality time watching one of her favorite shows on the Tivo.
**2. What were the last two movies you saw?
** 1. Beethoven
2. Scooby Doo, once again quality time with my little one.</description>

      <description>What started as a small project almost 4 months ago is now complete. To be honest we really thought it would be done by Christmas, but it was worth the wait. Throughout the process the artisit Jody became a part of our family. It was a total pleasure. If you are interested in hiring an amazing mural artist drop me a note and I’ll give you Jody’s contact information. Below are some final photographs of the completed project.</description>

      <description>During Scoble’s recent battle with designer’s about the look and feel of his site. Foo of ForgetFoo.com put some skin in the game creating a very sexy and lightweight design for Robert’s web site. This wasn’t the first time Foo has done this for Robert, check out Foo’s Longhorn edition of the Scobelizer. Long story short, Robert didn’t adopt either design, but Foo’s given me permission to leverage the templates and thus my new style is born.</description>

Years ago when I lived in Canada I played a fair amount of golf. At the company I worked for it was pretty much company policy that your customer meetings were to be done on the greens. This did little to improve my game (I’m a total hack), but I did make many friends and the customers loved it. Nothing beats four hours of fun with friends accompanied with great scenery and a few cold drinks.</description>

I’ve included updated photos below. This will be the final post of phots until its done. Maybe I’ll get Scoble to come over and take some quality shots when its done, or it least to drink a few.This first shot is up the stairway, we’re finally on that wall now. When complete this walll will have a doorway here, a coke sign and I believe some exposed brick.</description>

      <description>I think I know where Dave is headed with his new categorization system, or at least this is where I hope he is headed. 🙂
What if all Weblog entries had religous use of categories like Dave’s has been applying to his posts since inception? First off its not realistic to think everyone will change their ways and become the masters of categories. Also what I think might be a story about home improvement to another person could be about modern art.</description>

      <description>Well that is probably taking things a bit far, but boy are we excited with the progress this weekend on the mural. On Friday the scaffolding arrived and I helped Jodie put it up. Jodie has been telling us all week once the scaffolding goes up we’ll see things really come together. Wow, what an understatement! Look at all the work completed in the last 48 hours.Friday evening shortly after the scaffolding was erected.</description>

      <description>Slowly, but surely the mural is taking shape. Jodi is really taking her time on this, I believe this is her first major project so she’s trying to make a showcase out of it. We’re thrilled to have her talent involved in this.
Tomorrow the scaffolding arrives and Jodi says she’s going to be spending a lot of time here once it arrives. We’ll see a lot more progress then. Of course as the old cliche goes a picture is worth a thousand words, so I’ve uploaded some photos highlighting the progress to date.</description>

      <description>As a Rider fan I can’t count how many times I’ve said, well, maybe next year. This is unfortunately one of those years. The team really got it all together in the second half, but that was not enough leaving the final score 30 – 23 with Edmonton winning. I’m bummed, but I still love these guys!  </description>

This is cool. Why can’t they bring this to the United States? You know I hate to admit it, but I’ve been eating more than my fair share of fast food lately and I am so tired of it. I want Mc Curry! Check out the menu at McDonald’s of India, it looks great for fast food. Has anyone tried this?</description>

      <description>PDC is only 25 days a way and I can’t wait to see you all. Although it pales in comparison to the entries of the recent cool wallpaper desktop contest, here is a PDC 2003 inspired wallpaper. I believe this is the wallpaper that will be used on the CommNET machines… &amp;lt;img src=&amp;lsquo;http://radio.weblogs.com/0124699/images/MyDesktop.jpg&amp;quot;&amp;rsquo; border=0 PDC03Wallpaper.jpg? http: radio.weblogs.com 0124699 images&amp;gt;
Download it here
Enjoy!

      <title>PDC Flair – They&#39;re in the bushes?</title>

      <description>I was surfing around this morning reading Weblog’s to see who’s coming to the PDC and was confused by this trackback link on my post encouraging variations on the PDC 2003 sticker. What the heck does Stuart mean by “They’re in the bushes”  ?
Shrugging it off and wondering what inside joke I was missing I did a Feedster.com search for PDC 2003 and while checking out the links I found out what was going on.</description>

      <description>So I woke up this morning to the surprise of many of you picking up the PDC flair. Most likely due to a little Google juice supplied by Mr. Scoble and the aggregation of the homepage on http://weblogs.asp.net
Check out these variations:   
Well the third one I could do without :-), but that is reality. Thank you so much to all of you who are planning to attend the PDC.</description>

      <description>A little Weblog flair for PDC 2003 Attendees. Feel free to repurpose on your Weblog if you are coming to the PDC.

Maybe, I should update my Blogroll for people coming to the PDC. The list to the right looks accurate, I wonder if Dave is going to come?</description>

      <title>Trackback for Radio Userland</title>

      <description>Yes! Dave announced today that Jake has released trackback for Radio. Very cool, let’s see if this works. I wonder if Dave’s visit to California helped get this implemented or if it was just a coincidence. Time watch and see who implements it on their Weblogs.</description>

      <description>Recipe Time!
My mom tuned me into this recipe last time she was down visiting and I had to share. Sorry, but I don’t know who to credit this recipe to, but it is quick, fun and tastey. I did some Google Recipe hunting this morning and found the precise ingredients, even better they had the key ingredient at Safeway. Let me know if you try it.

      <description>I love my Toshiba Portege 3500 Tablet PC. It is beefy enough to run Visual Studio, has a decent battery life and a good size screen. In my office though I still use a desktop PC for my day to day work. I wanted a way to use the tablet also for running my news aggregator , viewing my schedule, while still using my monitor for my main PC. Here is what I did:</description>

      <description>I have for the past few months been enjoying my subscription to PressPlay. I take great interest in today’s news that Roxio has acquired PressPlay. It will be fun watching Roxio relaunch the Napster service.
My family is hooked on PressPlay. I have a PC configured with PressPlay connected to our Bose home theater. We use Windows XP’s Remote Desktop feature to control the PressPlay PC from a laptop via my home 802.</description>

      <description>I love how my plants are turning out this year. One of the nice things about Seattle’s winter of rain and gloom is that you appreciate the summer weather. I need to work on my plant selection though, when I picked the plants for my landscaping I didn’t get enough variety. Once my Rhododenreons loose their flowers my backyard loses some of its shine.So can
someone recommend plantings that will get me blooms from now until September?</description>

      <description>After many failed attempts at writing a web log and finally being encouraged by two co-workers to pick up the proverbial pen I’m at it once again. I’ve played with a number of the web-logging clients this last year. I’ve used Blogger.com for my family photo gallery, BlogX for an Internal weblog, Erablog to test the new Windows Media Plug-in and now Radio for this weblog. Radio has it quirks (doesn’t all software :-)), but I decided to shell out $39.</description>
