      <description>Last summer our oldest daughter was married and I had the awesome responsibility of saying a few words at the wedding reception to the newly married bride and groom.
I do a fair amount of speaking in my job as an Evangelist at Microsoft, but this was a very different talk. After a lot of thought (over months) on what to talk about, I came to the decision that I should relay one of the better pieces of advice that I have received.</description>

      <description>It snowed again this morning at our home in Fall City, Washington. I‚Äôm not sure when this cruel joke of winter will be over here. I moved away from Saskatchewan to leave snow. Although to keep it in perspective, it hasn‚Äôt really been cold. üôÇ
Making up for it all was this amazing photo that my wife captured this morning. Great show¬†of a hummingbird braving the winter for a drink in our backyard.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôm a major fan of the television program Diners Drive-Ins and Dives. This show with Guy Fieri goes across the United States popping into great places with good food. Here in Seattle I‚Äôve eaten a few times at Voula‚Äôs Offshore Cafe which has been on the show. You have to eat their Greek Hobo.
I‚Äôm actually on a secret mission (guess its not a secret now) to eat at all of the places that Guy Fieri frequents on his popular Food Network show.</description>

      <description>Once again for Mix, my team worked on what we call the live experience. Since PDC 2003, we‚Äôve been working on ways for the folks at home and those attending in person can make a connection to the event.

With¬†this work we‚Äôve streamed the keynotes live, published breakout sessions for on demand viewing, filmed behind the scenes videos for Channel 9 along with some humorous ones and even overlaid Tweets tagged #MIX09 on top of the live keynote player on the web site and on the big screens in the keynote halll via our Flotzam screen saver.</description>

      <description>My 9 year old daughter is a major fan of Disney‚Äôs Club Penguin. She loves to go online in this virtual world, hanging out with her friends, updating her status and buying virtual items to trick out her igloo.

Josie was sad this week when she attempted to login to Club Penguin and was denied access.

      <description>One of my more popular blog posts is where I explain how to push your Facebook status to Twitter. When I wrote this, about two years ago, people were more likely to update their Facebook status than Twitter. My hack with TwitterFeed made it simple to push that status update to Twitter.
Times have changed since then and I find myself updating my status to Twitter and wanting to be selective about what I update Facebook with my Twitter status.</description>

      <description>Today, my team has released Oxite.¬†Oxite is an open source, standards compliant, and highly extensible content management platform that can run anything from blogs to big web sites. We are releasing this as our second edition of the Mix Online web magazine that focusses on web standards.¬†Oxite¬†began as a side project of Adam Kinney and Duncan Mackenzie and is a subset of the Channel 9¬†source code. When it was time to do a reboot of the Mix Online¬†web site¬†Duncan and his team created an experience where could release the source code (a popular customer request of Channel 9) that used ASP.</description>

      <description>I promised that I would be back.
I am.
It has been a very exciting time with Microsoft PDC week now here. One of the things that is new from my team is the PDC live event coverage.
On the homepage of the PDC Website, you are able to watch the day 1 and 2 keynotes live. We‚Äôve also superimposed recent activity from Twitter alongside the keynote stream. This is one of my favorite parts of the experience.</description>

      <description>This morning we posted a very special interview on Channel 9¬†with Bill Gates.¬†In this video interview, Charles Torre sits down with Bill Gates and they talk about everything from philantropy, the CSA role, competition with Google and platforms.
I believe this will go down as one of our greatest Channel 9 interviews of all time and with a little over 1600 videos¬†produced to date, that is saying something.</description>

      <description>Today we completed the deployment of Channel 9 Version 4.0. We‚Äôre still doing some final stabilization work that includes tweaking performance, but we‚Äôre on our way. This is a 100 per cent rewrite of the predecessor and has been a long time in the making.
A little over five years ago Channel 9 came on the air, some would say ushering in a wave of transparency for Microsoft and becoming a poster child for corporate blogging.</description>

      <description>For the past five and a half years, I‚Äôve been running DasBlog. It has served me well over the years and I‚Äôm really appreciative of Chris Anderson for giving it a start with BlogX and finally to Clemens, Omar and Scott for moving it along as DasBlog.
For quite some time¬†I have wanted to make a move to something that had more extensibility, better themes and more of a self service admin.</description>

 After years of pushing for a mountain-bike ‚Äúskills park‚Äù on the Sammamish Plateau, the Backcountry Bicycle Trails Club got a $150,000 boost from King County to move forward with its plans, county officials announced Wednesday.
The club signed an agreement to work with the county on developing the 120-acre project at Duthie Hill Park, a swath of second-growth conifers and deciduous trees that is underused, county officials say.</description>

I will miss his brutal honesty, book recommendations and never-ending support for the community work my team does with Channels 8,9, 10 and Edge.
An anonymous commenter over on Mini, nailed it when they wrote the following about Charles:
 If you ever sat in any of his presentations at places like the Platform Strategy Review events, and talked with our top customers, he ‚Äògot‚Äô them and they ‚Äògot‚Äô him.</description>

      <description>The place that I grew up at on Holmgren Bay in Estevan, Saskatchewan has now been sold.¬†Estevan, an area rich is natural resources, is booming right now.¬†There is a lack of housing now so the sale was very quick.
Mom and Dad will be moving out to condo life on the west coat of Canada taking new roots in Kelowna, B.C.¬†For Mom and Dad this will mean a warmer climate, the end of yard maintenance and a much shorter trip to visit us down in Fall City, Washington.</description>

The half pipe was to tall for Josie to get to the top.</description>

      <description>With the addition of public facing feeds to Facebook I am now able to publish my status on Facebook to Twitter.¬†Here‚Äôs how you can do it also.
First, find your status RSS feed on Facebook.¬†It is buried.¬†(Thanks Bizzle!¬†for helping me find mine.)¬†To find it, you need to visit your profile on Facebook and on your mini-feed select &amp;ldquo;See All&amp;rdquo;.¬†On the right you will see a list of items, select ‚Äústatus stories‚Äù and finally below this a feed link can be found.</description>

      <description>Is Amazon opening up a grocery service?¬†I spotted this interesting truck today in Bellevue, Washington.¬†
I sure hope they are opening a grocery service.¬†Our family loved the now defunct HomeGrocer.com service from the late 90s.¬†We were &amp;ldquo;beta testers&amp;rdquo; and used it as our only grocery service for quite some time.
The services Safeway and Albertsons have opened just don‚Äôt compare to what was Home Grocer.
Anyone have a link to Amazon Fresh or a beta invite?</description>

      <description>Over on WinBeta they are writing:
 Microsoft has a giant presence on Facebook, with over 17,000 employees (out of 70,000 worldwide) joining their Facebook network. Since you need a Microsoft email address to get it, it‚Äôs highly unlikely these are anything but real Microsofties, and the large number means Facebook is becoming a pretty important means of communication inside MS.
You‚Äôll be able to find the real profile of Bill Gates in there, and discover that he has only 57 friends, while Ray Ozzie has 105 friends, including Mike Arrington, Steve Ballmer, Don Box, Joanne Bradford, Steve Case, Steve Chen, Anil Dash, Gary Flake, Steven Levy of Newsweek, Dare Obasanjo, Jeff Sandquist, Robert Scoble, and Mark Zuckerberg.</description>

Many folks back in Estevan believe I am related to the Symons Family.¬†We‚Äôre not, at least not by blood.¬†In fact some of the best family are the ones you choose.
I got to¬†know George and family when¬†my mother went to work for them running their grocery wholesale business back in the 80‚Äôs.</description>

      <description>I haven‚Äôt updated this blog with my recovery progress since having PRK. PRK is a laser eye procedure different than Lasik.¬†PRK¬†has a much longer recovery time.¬†The goal of both Lasik and PRK is the same, which is to enable people to see without glasses.¬†I had wavefront guided custom PRK.
For the first few days with PRK there was a great deal of discomfort and it has taken about a week to regain semi-functional vision without the use of eyeglasses.</description>

I‚Äôve loaded up an MP3 player with audio books and music to help pass the time.

      <description>Lasik surgery that is.
For over 25 years I‚Äôve worn glasses.¬†Without my glasses I am useless.¬†I‚Äôve tried contact lenses but have had problems with getting them in my eyes.
Thursday though, hopefully will be the end of my relationship with eyeglasses.¬†I am going in for Lasik surgery.¬†Technically it is not Lasik that I am getting.¬†Due to some anomalies with my eyes I will need to have PRK (Photorefractive Keratectomy) instead.</description>

We‚Äôve heard of Locks of Love and we were explaining to Josie how long its taken to grow her hair from super-short to just at her bum (2 solid years) and she really didn‚Äôt care. Ah well, it‚Äôs just hair, right? üôÇ
So, with one cut, Josie lost nearly 12 inches of hair and then Lauri spent another 15 minutes evening it all up and she has a cute new summer ‚Äòdo.</description>

      <description>Josie and I have been on the road since Sunday morning for our big trip.¬†We decided to delay our departure by a day so we could pack, get the windshield repaired on my car and make sure we‚Äôre rested up.
It has been a wonderful trip.¬†We have put on almost 1300 miles so far and have put a few photos up on our Flickr set in the process of getting here.</description>

      <description>Friday morning, around 7 am, Lauri noticed a little hummingbird in our backyard, trying to get something out of the globe lights around our umbrella. Interesting.
Around 7 am this morning, the hummingbird was back, only this time it was sticking its long beak into the orange bell shaped blossoms on our Thompson Maple tree that we had planted when my folks were in town. She had looked up online what to put in the feeders, and boiled some water, let it cool down and added the sugar.</description>

      <description>Think you can predict the future of tech? üôÇ¬†Check out this post by Jon Udell from almost 5 years ago:
 Duncan Wilcox ruminates on how blogs can help implement the communication strategies outlined in the Cluetrain manifesto:
 Of course it‚Äôs not as if starting a weblog automatically opens a corporation up to conversations, but it‚Äôs a good start. For example reading Ray Ozzie‚Äôs weblog has made me very interested in Groove (the product) and generally makes me feel good about Groove (the company) ÔøΩ in long term that would make me trust both.</description>

Microsoft has a really cool voice-controlled system. You dial the number, an electronic voice answers and asks you for the person‚Äôs name you‚Äôre trying to reach. You SAY it. ‚ÄúJeff Sandquist‚Äù and then it comes back with a recording of Jeff Sandquist so you know you‚Äôre going to the right place. ‚ÄúAre you looking for ‚ÄòJeff Sandquist, Channel 9‚Ä≤‚Äù?</description>

The move to FeedBurner should be complete.¬†Note to folks who plan on doing¬†this with Dasblog.¬†The configuration page in Dasblog asks for your FeedBurner username.¬†It doesn‚Äôt really want that.
My username for FeedBurner is JeffSand, but my feed is http://feeds.feedburner.com/jeffsandquist, so on the configuration page for DasBlog I had to specify JeffSandquist, not JeffSand.
I think if you make this mistake you potentially could lose subscribers if their aggregator gets an incorrect 302 message from DasBlog.</description>

      <description>It will be a light posting on my blog this week as I‚Äôm taking the week off to get settled in our new home.¬†There is a much longer post coming up soon on what I did learn through this around contingencies, selling your home in general and what a difference a great real estate agent can make.¬†This is definitely an industry that needs technology.¬†The whole process quite complicated and delivered stress at a level I‚Äôve never encountered¬†before.</description>

      <description>Just a quick note this morning to confirm that Michael Gartenberg [is joining Microsoft as an Enthusiast Evangelist][1].
After working as an industry analyst for more than decade, I‚Äôm leaving JupiterResearch to join Microsoft as an enthusiast evangelist. What is an enthusiast evangelist? Our job is to find, engage and work with enthusiasts and other influencers and show them all the cool stuff that Microsoft is doing. In short, it‚Äôs our job to act as the bridge between Microsoft and end users.</description>

      <description>Not sure how I missed this cool Pandora Tray Application.¬†I love Pandora¬†for listening to music, but don‚Äôt like that I have to keep a browser window open to run it .¬†This application allows me to tune into my Pandora channels, rate songs and most importantly minimize the action to my system tray.¬†(Hat tip: Adam Kinney)

      <description>Our new home has a very cool panel in the master bedroom closet.¬†The panel is made by General Electric and is called the GE Smart ConnectionCenter.¬†This unit brings everything from coaxial cable, home networking and telephone into a central point.¬†From there it redistributes it to all the rooms in the rest of the home.¬†Every room has multiple networking drops and coaxial cable.¬†A nice touch in the panel is the video amplifier¬†which should help minimize signal loss when the coaxial cables are split in th panel.</description>

      <description>So it has been almost 24 hours since my A little freaked out in Dehli post.¬†I was able to make alternative travel arrangements last night through corporate travel as there was a high probability that my flight out of Heathrow to Seattle could be cancelled on Sunday.¬†(The BBC news is reporting 40% of flights out of Heathrow right now are cancelled).¬†This does mean that I will be getting home about 24 hours sooner than planned, Saturday afternoon.</description>

      <description>Ok, my wife is sleeping right now and I am sitting here in Delhi and what‚Äôs running through my mind is when my wife will hear the news about the terrorist plot being¬†thwarted in London.¬†Charles, Laura and I are watching the BBC news here in Delhi and are pretty freaked out.¬†The way we understand it now is that certain American airlines like United, Continental and American were targetted by terrorists.</description>

Be really clear up front that you want something beyond reproach, that‚Äôs in the middle of the road, that will cause no controversy and will echo your competition. It‚Äôll save everyone a lot of time.  On the other hand, if you want great work, you‚Äôll need to embrace some simple facts:  It‚Äôs going to offend someone.</description>

      <description>For the last 20 years July 27th has been a very sad day.¬†You see July 27th is the anniversary of when my only brother died.¬†Rod was 21 years old and was killed in a head on collision while driving home to Estevan, Saskatchewan fro Regina.¬†This year marks the 20th anniversary.
It happened during a really bad rainstorm when a truck hydroplaned, lost control and drove head on into his car.</description>

Along with the 5 Temptations of a CEO, the 10 Commandments of Email is another great read.¬† Don‚Äôt use your in-box as a catchall folder for everything you need to work on. Read items once, and answer them immediately if necessary, delete them if possible, or move them to project-specific folders.  Set up a ‚ÄúFive Weeks Folder‚Äù that deletes its content automatically after five weeks. Use it as a repository for messages you‚Äôre unsure about, such as that email you want to delete, but you‚Äôre not sure if the guy‚Äôs going to call you tomorrow and ask about it.</description>

The idea is that once you‚Äôve used a piece of software for seven days you‚Äôll know whether it is a keeper or not.¬†In fact that is about the point that I decide to uninstall and never use sofware again if it is a dud.</description>

I like to think of the end goal for sites like Channel 9 and 10 is to have something that resembles a music festival.¬†If you attend a music festival like Bumbershoot¬†or Farm Aid¬†what you notice right away is that often the most interesting aspects of the event aren‚Äôt always happening on mainstage.</description>

      <description>So last night at the recommendation of Jeff Erwin I picked up some of Patrick Lencioni‚Äôs books. I blazed through the Five Temptations of a CEO, it is a very quick read that you can easily get through in one sitting.¬†Really good, common sense advice.¬†The book is written as a short story that reminded me of David Chilton‚Äôs Wealthy Barber series.

      <description>Some really good coments over on Scoble‚Äôs post about leadership.¬†I‚Äôve never been a big fan of the term management, I prefer leadership.¬†Managers have subordinates, leaders have followers. In one of the comments Jeff Erwin recommends Patrick M. Lencioni‚Äôs books on leadership.¬†He writes:‚ÄúMy best advice is to go purchase all five books written by Patrick M. Lencioni and read them each twice. This will take you about one day to do, they are fast reads and very interesting.</description>

      <description>I started skateboarding when I was six years old.¬†This was when I was also riding BMX freestyle and riding motocross.¬†I‚Äôve always wanted to live my life a little on the edge.¬†Now that I have kids and think about my passions from the past, I wonder how my parents slept at night, wondering if a trip to the ER was on the agenda for the next day.¬†This morning Josie and I were digging through old photo albums to see if I could show her a photo of her dad doing handstands or a 360 on a half pipe when I was six.</description>

      <description>Paul reviews the Google Pack¬†and his conclusion is:While virtually every computer company on earth is scared to death of Google, and virtually every PC user seems to be in love with them, Google Pack serves nicely as a reality check. Not only is Google human, buts the flaws in Google Pack suggest that this company has a long, long way to go before it can ever justify its insanely lofty stock price.</description>

      <description>Man, Josie and I noticed over Christmas that Boomerang¬†is now available via Comcast On Demand in our neighborhood.¬†(On Demand -&amp;gt; Kids -&amp;gt; Boomerang).¬†Boomerang has all those great classic cartoons (that used to be on Cartoon Network) like the Jetsons, Flintstones, Scooby Doo and more.¬†Stuff I grew up on Saturday mornings or lunch time home from school (our local TV played Flintstones for years at noon)
So far Comcast hasn‚Äôt brought it on nationally as a channel, the DSL Reports Comcast Forums¬†are saying that most areas now have it as On Demand, but only Atlanta (where Turner Broadcasting is based) gets Boomerang in its full channel 24/7 glory.</description>

 Turn down a big VC firm.
Randomly pick a super large VC firm, hit the about our people page, find the ‚Äúassociates‚Äù, and send one a letter declining to allow the firm to participate in your next fund raising. Make it all official like, use buzz words like synergy, web 2.0 personification, and mention that, ‚Äúfrankly that associate of yours really didn‚Äôt understand basics of recurring revenue on a recursive basis.</description>

      <description>They are talking about it on memorandum here, you can play with the site at http://local.live.com and of course learn more on Channel 9 in this video.
I was very pleased to see how up to date the imagery is.¬†We painted our house in the middle of September and the bird‚Äôs eye view photographs include our new home color so they must have been taken pretty recently.</description>

      <description>We added a new feature to Channel 9 last night called shows.¬†We‚Äôll be using this feature as a way to group content on Channel 9 that going beyond our current use of tags.¬†We found that we were using tags to do groupings of videos and podcasts (e.g. The IIS Shows, ArcCast, Going Deep) when they really are much better used to organize our content by technology.¬†With the introduction of shows we can do the grouping in a more logical way and still tag each individual show by technology.</description>

The hot link pro has gotten rave reviews out in the message boards.</description>

¬†Before

The Harmony 880 Advanced Universal Remote makes my home theater much easier to use as it combines the remotes for my XBox, Media Center PC, Plasma, Comcast HD DVR, Component Video Switchbox and Bose Lifestyle system into one remote.¬†I‚Äôve seen lots of universal remotes in the past but there are few things that make this one a buy in my house.</description>

      <description>Have you seen the cool application running inside the PDC?¬†Its built on Avalon and combines session data, show announcements, Channel 9 videos aligned with the event and finally attendee photos.¬†The data is consumed from RSS feeds that we created for the event.
Joe Smith and Ernie Booth are the folks behind the code of the application.¬†Remember Vibe from the last PDC?¬†This application in Avalon took the most popular used features from Vibe and is made available via the plasmas at the venue.</description>

      <description>Just noticed News.com now has a tag cloud.¬†Kind of a cool user experience where as you type a tag name it shortens down the resultset.¬†As we add more tags to Channel 9¬†we‚Äôll probably have to do something like this.
Too bad they don‚Äôt have friendly URLs like http://channel9.msdn.com/tags/avalon and also they don‚Äôt include the rel=‚Äùtag‚Äù item to their links though.

      <description>Congratulations to the folks at Konfabulator on being acquired by Yahoo! If you‚Äôve never used it, give it¬†a whirl (its now free) and the class act that they are, they are giving folks who bought Konfabulator 2.0 a refund. Now can someone please write a Flickr photoviewer like this for Konfabulator? Now that Yahoo! owns them (and since they also own Flickr) this seems like a no brainer.
_Update: John in my comments for this post explains that the standard Konfabulator photo frame widget does support Flickr.</description>

      <description>Cooter is pissed:Former Georgia Congressman Ben Jones, who played ‚ÄúCooter‚Äù on the hit TV series ‚ÄúThe Dukes of Hazzard,‚Äù has blasted the new film version to be released in August as a ‚Äúprofanity-laced script with blatant sexual situations that mocks the good clean family values of our series.‚Äù
In an open letter to the fans of the show on his Web site, Jones says that ‚Äúrather than honoring our legendary show, they have chosen to degrade it.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôm getting some heat by Ross Jones in the comments for my post about the MSN Screensaver that it requires the MSN Toolbar to function. Whilst I don‚Äôt want to rain on your parade isn‚Äôt putting functionality (search) on a screensaver fairly pointless? Do you tend to sit and try and use your computer when the screensaver is on? Personally the only time I ever see it is when I come back to my computer and press space to re-activate it.</description>

Scanned images or photographs usually capture a limited amount of information, forcing us to take multiple scans/photos of a panoramic view or a large original image.Microsoft Acrylic provides one of the best image-stitching features by seamlessly combining multiple images. This feature was a direct result of our collaboration with MSR.</description>

      <description>My team at Microsoft is quite lively as it includes both the folks behind Channel 9 and Evangelists for both Visual Studio 2005 and also Longhorn.
What I absolutely love about our team is the lively debates we have about strategy, technology and our overall direction as a team and company. The amazing thing is no matter how spirited the discussion gets or how much might disagree about an item, we aways leave the discussion as friends and with mutual respect.</description>

.NET Undocument writes an interesting history of the road to Getting Web Services: The notion of ‚Äúsoftware as a service‚Äù has gradually become a coherent and unifying story throughout Microsoft. I see it in the .NET framework support for web services and ClickOnce, in Indigo‚Äôs¬†attempts to unify the various Windows communications approaches into a simple, common services-based API, in¬†Avalon‚Äôs borrowing of UI patterns (deployment, inductive UI, markup, navigation) from the Web.</description>

Offsites serve as a a great way to get everyone away from email, the daily routines and devote a solid day to planning. From my previous experience at offsites you never quite know what you‚Äôll get out of an offsite.</description>

      <description>Powerful blog post from Lenn:We have decided to consider making Tallinn home, but have a little more thinking to sort out. Watching a country with a great and deep history and culture emerge from 50 years of soviet occupation is something quite amazing to see. The people are smart, well educated, hard working, kind if not a bit distant. They are also stunningly beautiful as a whole. It is a unique place with a unique culture and a unique language reshaping itself in a new era.</description>

      <description>Found this little gem today [over on the Channel 9 Coffee House][1]:
A couple of other ex-MS employees and I have created a futuristic animation of Microsoft campus.¬†Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) technology is a new transit technology under development and could be commercialized as soon as 2008.¬†PRT is a ‚Äúpacket switched people mover,‚Äù faster than a car.¬†Buildings 26-28, Troon, and Augusta were modeled for this animation, with PRT zooming around the buildings.</description>

      <description>Scoble started a list awhile back of why he is at Microsoft¬†in response to Joel. For me its the people, the passion and the fact that despite some opinions of late we are getting stuff done.
Dean and the rest of ‚ÄúMicrosoft‚Äôs Longhorn, Browing and RSS Team‚Äù (time for you to rename your blog) gave me yet another reason yesterday at Gnomedex. You can watch the video here¬†on Channel 9.</description>

      <description>So I made a post the other night about something that Steve Cellini and the PDC Team¬†had put in my office¬†while I was on the road. I was asking if someone could take a picture. I wanted to see what it was before I returned and share it via my blog.
No one on my team would comply. I was more than slightly annoyed.
Good thing they didn‚Äôt listen to me üôÇ It would have given away the surprise.</description>

      <description>As I wrote earlier, I‚Äôm on the road with Sanjay visiting customers and connecting with our local Evangelists. It has been a great week so far, but quite intense. We‚Äôve been packing a lot into each day. From reading Steve‚Äôs blog tonight, it looks like I‚Äôve got a surprise waiting for me in my office.Also, today, a couple of us dragged what seemed to be a small yellow rectangular body / structure into Jeff‚Äôs office.</description>

It will be a whirlwind trip taking us from Chicago to Denver to San Diego to Santa Monica then home to¬†Seattle. All beginning with a 6:10 am flight Monday¬†morning.¬†Nothing beats getting out on the road and meeting with customers and I am really excited to go on this trip.</description>

Awesome!

      <description>Just surfing through my aggregator tonight and noticed a post from Marc Canter where he includes a screenshot of a new tool that he‚Äôs building that he calls a micro-contentaggregator, that will render out all the microformats from all over the web.
Sort of reminds me of of the recently released  project. In addition to remembering my recent searches and having a clean user experience it aggregates all sorts of microcontent, ranging from astronomy pics of the day, scoble, engadget and more.</description>

      <description>Do you remember the excitement you felt as a child when you wrote your first simple program?
I do.
I started with a hangman style game on my Commodore 64 that was written in BASIC.¬†Then it was on to application that helped me memorize french verbs, next a variation of Pacman followed and the last program written on my Commodore 64 was a Bulletin Board System that used Assembly Language for speed and Basic for ease of customization.</description>

      <description>Hey with all the changes going on and the Channel 9 Team coming back over to my group¬†I bet many of you want to join in the fun! Yup, you heard right our team is growing and I‚Äôve got a couple of open positions to fill.
In my opinion the Developer and Platform Evangelism Group is the only place to work in Microsoft. If you‚Äôre already employed at Microsoft and are even considering making a career change_,_ take a peak at the positions I have available below, and if one of them is your dream job send me a note and we should get together for a quick informational.</description>

      <description>Recently while reading a hometown newspaper I stumbled across the painting to the right of the school I attended as a child. This painting by Gail Frasz brings back great memories of the small farming community of Benson where I grew up and went to school. I think the population back then was around 100 people.
I spent most of my free time riding dirt bikes in the summer, snowmobiles in the winter and my horse Flash the rest of the time.</description>

      <description>Heard about the Coral Castle in Florida on the radio last night.If you had visited Coral Castle 60 years ago, you would have been greeted enthusiastically by a man weighing a mere 100 pounds and standing just over 5 feet tall. He would have asked you for ten cents admission and introduced you to his fantasy world carved out of stone.
Interesting, check out the photo gallery¬†and an aerial photo.</description>

      <description>Internet Anxiety Disorder ‚ÄìHat tip to Slashdot.orgWe live in an always on, ever connected world. My phone, wireless and wired rings constantly, and missed calls and voice mails pile-up even before the coffee stops brewing early in the morning. There are tips from sources, a friend on east coast on his way to work wanting to recap the Yankees game, and an occasional message of concern from mom! Time to boot up the computer and be greeted by an early morning assault of emails, sometimes as many as 100, and that‚Äôs before Sun‚Äôs first rays caress the Coit Tower.</description>

In doing this most RSS aggregators probably think that all my items have changed because the guids are now different. Sorry about that, but I think its worth the change. My old links will continue to work.</description>

Leo here, I am a 4 year old cocker spaniel and am guest blogging tonight for my Dad. Dad is very angry with me, it started last night at 3:00 am, I was quite hungry and there was no food in my bowl.
So I found these wonderfully tasty things on the floor next to Dad‚Äôs night stand. Hey if they are on the floor, they are fair game right?</description>

      <description>As of Wednesday this week, I reach quite the milestone. Wednesday is my final appointment with my trainer for the 20/20 Program.¬†The program is broken into a phase 1 (I call it boot camp :-)) and phase 2 which is maintenance.
In phase 1, I went from 205 pounds to 157 pounds. I did drop a fair amount of weight before starting the program, nonetheless worked my butt off through phase 1 getting myself down to my ideal body weight in time for phase 2.</description>

On the shelf were a number of books from my childhood by Doctor Seuss and the Berenstains. There is something quite soothing turning the pages of a book that was read to you as a child to your own children.</description>

Photographs and moving images capture moments from the attack, and visitors confront powerful artifacts including twisted steel from the World Trade Center, damaged items from the Pentagon, memorials from the crash site in Pennsylvania, clothing worn by survivors, and objects used by rescue workers and public officials.</description>

      <description>From Microsoft Partners with Tivo:Microsoft Chairman and Founder Bill Gates announced during his keynote address tonight at the Consumer Electronics Show that the two companies have embarked on a collaborative effort designed to allow consumers to take digital entertainment with them on portable devices.
Gates demonstrated how television programs stored on a TiVo¬Æ box can be transferred to a Windows XP PC for playback on Windows Mobile devices, including Portable Media Centers, and media-capable Pocket PCs and Smart phones.</description>

      <description>Tivo today released the TivoToGo feature that allows Tivo users to transfer television programs from their Tivo to a computer. When a solution from Sonic ships you will also be able to burn the transfered programs to DVD via the PC.¬†For more information I recommend this post on the TivoCommunity.com forum. If you‚Äôre interested in playing with this feature and don‚Äôt have a Tivo, I‚Äôve still got one left for sale after deciding to turn off my Tivo.</description>

      <description>I heard about the keyboard organizer last night and it was one of those ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt I think of that ideas?‚Äù
I love a clean desk, I can‚Äôt think with lots of clutter, but there always seems to be a CD, a notepad or a pencil laying around.¬†This here wold be the answer for me.
Unfortunately though it will not work for me as I use my Sony VAIO as my desktop machine by connecting a monitor to it and a keyboard/mouse via Bluetooth.</description>

Check out the following from Sound Politics:
 It was last reported that there were 3,539 more ballots counted in King County than voters who cast them. The discrepancy is actually much larger. The 3,539 is only the net.</description>

I‚Äôve poked fun at this idiotic notion of multitasking here, here, and here, too. And I try to ignore ‚Äî or at least placate ‚Äî people who tell me I should multitask more (as if I‚Äôm not forced to multitask enough already). Instead, I‚Äôm making a major effort to narrow my activities and focus focus focus. The more I do this the more relaxed I become and the more successful I feel.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôve got the AudioVox that Scoble talks about continously and am fortunate to also have the XDA III. I prefer the XDA III over the Audiovox. The slide out keyboard makes it great for¬†doing mail and its killer to have built in 802.11 support. After years of syncing a phone or putting up with slow GPRS, its empowering to use a Pocket PC on a high speed LAN.
The Audiovox is a great phone and a great pric, but the screen is too small for¬†my¬†daily usage and I‚Äôve never gotten used to typing fast using the keypad.</description>

      <description>Here‚Äôs my last thought on the election in Washington State. If it is not obvious, I‚Äôm a big fan of Rossi. I love his pro-business outlook and what he did to keep this state from a distasterous California like budget shortfall through crafting of a miracle budget.
As chairman of the Senate Ways and Means Committee, he drove around the state on a trip in which he tried to fashion a consensus of Republicans and Democrats on a budget that didn‚Äôt raise taxes and preserved programs for the elderly and developmentally disabled.</description>

 TiVo, listen up and listen good: these things have dual tuners (don&amp;rsquo;t even try and tell us it&amp;rsquo;s not necessary), they record HDTV, rock HD video on demand, and still do 60 hours of regular TV. And they cost the consumer nothing but an extra $10 per month.  I loved my Tivo before getting the Comcast box.

Here‚Äôs all I had to do:
 Let my service contract for Cingular end so I could move on. I called T-Mobile and told them my Cingular phone number and Cingular Account Number T-Mobile sent me a new SIM chip (I have an XDA II phone that is unlocked so all I needed was the chip) Replaced the Cingular SIM chip in my phone with T-Mobile and it worked with my original phone number.</description>

Today in the United States it is Veteran‚Äôs Day. I found a short video from a CBS affiliate that is relevant to today‚Äôs war in Iraq.

      <description>Friday (yesterday) marked the beginning of week 6 for me and the 20/20 Program at the Pro Sports Club. I‚Äôm now down to 172 pounds and have been losing weight at the rate of 2 to 3 pounds per week. I did lose about 10¬†pounds before actually beginning the program.
Yesterday, was a breakthrough day. I participated in a Spinning Class with my trainer. Spinning is something I have always wanted to try and had hoped to do by the end of the program.</description>

      <description>Now we wait for Kerry to give his concession speech or the armies lawyers to descend upon Ohio. My Wife and I believe President Bush won tonight, but I am sure others feel Kerry still has a chance to win.
Moments ago I hung our American flag proudly out in front of our home. This was the flag our family purchased on the afternoon of September 11, 2001. It is the first American flag I‚Äôve ever owned, as I am originally from Canada.</description>

      <description>I can‚Äôt vote tomorrow because I‚Äôm Canadian, but here‚Äôs some good advice from the folks over at Electoral Vote Predictor 2004
Read carefully. Your vote could decide this election.   Find out today where your polling place is by calling your county clerk or checking www.mypollingplace.com  Alternatively, call 1-866-MYVOTE1 to find your polling place.  Check the hours the polls are open with your city or county clerk.  Print the League of Women Voters&amp;#8217; card in English or Spanish and put it in your wallet or purse.</description>

      <description>News.com: George W. Bush is heading for a surprise landslide victory in next week‚Äôs presidential elections, going by online betting patterns.
This article is based on¬†what Betfair.com is disclosing on wagers they have received on the election. Their figures show 2.3 million pounds ($4.2 million) have been wagered on Bush, while Kerry has attracted only 680,000 pounds ($1.25 million) in bets. The Betfair.com folks say that Bush is now at 1-5 odds to stay in office, whereas gamblers can still get odds of 2-1 on Kerry to win.</description>

      <description>Today marks the beginning of week 5 for me and the 20/20 program. An amazing change is taking place in my life.
When I first started the program my trainer had the tension level on the ellipticals set to 3 and this was the most I could do. My heart rate would quickly rise to over 160 and I‚Äôd tire out quickly.
Last night was quite a different story, we had the tension level set to 8 and my heart rate was at 155.</description>

This looks kind of cool, but a bit pricey. I‚Äôd definitely look at replacing my Roady with this since it can be used in the car via an FM Modulator or Tape Adapter then used for jogging. The cool thing is its like a Tivo in a way because you can store up to 5 hours of programming on the internal storage. This can be recorded on the fly or even scheduled.</description>

      <description>More fun trying to cancel my Audible.com account this afternoon. To see how this started in part 1 of this saga.
I called their 1-800 number at around 3:05 PM and after waiting on hold (listening to an audio book they had for background music)¬†at 3:30 I got a represenative who verified who I was and asked what I wanted to do.
When I told her that I wanted to cancel she put me back on hold and said she‚Äôd have to transfer for me to someone else.</description>

      <description>I ran into the same problem that Jerermy Zawodny and a few others did as well. There is no way on the Audible.com web site to cancel your subscription. *sigh*
To cancel the Audible subscription, I had to:
 Search and search their site for where to cancel and opt out Send a customer service request to ask how I got an email back saying they need me to call a number Wait on hold (still on hold now)  Goodbye Audible, I‚Äôll never be back.</description>

Sad, both young folks were talented in their own ways and at very exciting times in their lives.</description>

      <description>Scoble and so many others have been blogging lately about Podcasting. I am a super fan of this, if you are not yet, I encourage you to do this:
Burn a few Podcasts to a portable device or even a blank CD and take them with you for a drive, its great content and fun.
One thing though I think Scoble is confusing folks when he calls things great for Podcasting.</description>

      <description>What an amazing week!
I‚Äôve made it through the first 7 days of the 20/20 program. The past week has been full of big changes for me. The first part is the diet change which has been hard but not impossible. I met with my dietician and she gave me a bunch of vitamins and minerals (fish oil caplets, calcium and daily multi vitamins), a log book to record eactly what I eat each day, the calories and the total fat.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôm seriosuly thinking about adding a Podcast to the mix here, probably won‚Äôt be a daily show do to time commitments, but it will be at least weekly (on¬†Saturdays). Just trying to see if I‚Äôll make it solo or get someone to join in the party. The question remains will it just be rambling or be focused on some particular topic.
I think I‚Äôve just about got the setup configured on my PC, just a couple of more things to test.</description>

      <description>I just found one written on .NET up on Source Forge via the comments on Carl Frankin‚Äôs weblog. You can download an early alpha of it here. Just testing this now on my laptop, let you know if it works.
Postscript: It download sucessfully the Adam Curry‚Äôs daily source code and Evil Genius Chronicles adding them to iTunes. It did eventually crash, but for alpha this is cool.

      <description>I am starting my eighth year at Microsoft and although this last year was chalk full of amazing experiences, building Channel 9, it was time for some changes.
For those that don‚Äôt know me I started at Microsoft in PSS supporting Visual InterDev 1.0 and Active Server Pages 1.0. I did that for about two years and went on to work in Visual Studio / MSDN. I worked in this group as a Program Manager building sites like Code Center¬†and Lighthouse which was a service for the Visual Studio Shell that provided up to date data from MSDN to the shell.</description>

      <description>While on vacation this summer and doing some work around the house, I did not have the energy I used to have. Carrying furniture around and moving things up and down stairs made me sweat like a pig. I‚Äôd lose my breath and got tired needing a break before the job was done. To think I used to race BMX and ride motocross, where did it go?
Up until the the last few years I could eat lots of anything and my metabolism would make it go away.</description>

I‚Äôm searching the Blogosphere to see who people think the winner of the debate was. So far I see the left and right both calling out their respective candidate as the winner.
The election will be decided for the most part by the undecided voter, so I am more interested in hearing who the undecided voter thought one the debate tonight.</description>

I‚Äôve watched them on television ever since I can remember. think Lauri and I started donating to Farm Aid shortly after we moved to the United States from Canada. My grandfather farmed and I have great memories being out on the farm with him during harvest.</description>

      <description>I was bummed when the XM PCR was taken off the market. I wanted to use it to broadcast XM Radio throughout my home over my network. I had no desire to break the law and rip music with the recording software that caused its early demise. I just wanted a way to broadcast tunes throughout my home and control it through my computer.
Today XM announced that they will ship XM Radio Online and because I already subscribe to their Satellite service I can join in the phone $3.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôm spending the weekend up in Sebastopol, California for a private event. Driving up from San Francisco this afternoon I stumbled across the Glenn Beck radio program. Glenn was talking about how he dreamt for the day that 9/10 would return. You know all of us remember where we were on 9/11, but I am not sure if we all remember where we were on 9/10.
Glenn played a very touching audio compilation of radio programs, aircraft tower transmissions and other coverage from the day.</description>

      <description>I run Comcast as my broadband provider up here in Sammamish and I just completed a speed test over at Broadbandreports.com
Your download speed : 2979006 bps, or 2909 kbps.
A 363.6 KB/sec transfer rate.
Your upload speed : 239374 bps, or 233 kbps.
It is too bad (although understandable) that they restrict upload speeds as I‚Äôd probably look at putting my externally hosted sites in my home. I wonder how far we are away from the personal server at home for serving up web pages, weblogs and other content.</description>

      <description>From News.com
 Since XM discontinued the PCR, units have fetched steep premiums on eBay. The device, which retailed for about $50, is getting bids of more than $350 in recent auctions, with sellers advertising the unit as &amp;#8220;discontinued&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;rare.&amp;#8221;  Looks like I missed the boat on this one.&amp;nbsp;I was just telling Lenn last week how I was going to snag one of the PCR units up. I think he was going to get one too.</description>

      <description>I am really looking forward to playing Fable for the Xbox.¬†Based on the team‚Äôs webcam, it went gold this past week.The XBox site
describes Fable like this:
Fable‚Ñ¢ is a ground-breaking role-playing adventure game from Peter Molyneux, in which your every action determines your skills, appearance, and reputation.
Create your life story from childhood to death.¬†Grow from an inexperienced adolescent into the most powerful being in the world.¬†Choose the path of righteousness or dedicate your life to evil.</description>

      <description>Dave Winer¬†writes:Looks like the next stop will be Winnipeg, then across Saskatchewan, Alberta, into Vancouver and back into the US near Seattle.  If you are willing to steer of off the trans-Canada¬†a couple of hours you can stop by my hometown of
Estevan, Saskatchewan, Canada. Your timing is perfect for a visit to Saskatchewan as the harvest should be in full swing.¬†Make sure you pull over once or twice to ask the farmers in the field how the crops are doing.</description>

      <description>From [XM 411][1]:
The space at the top right now has three buttons; PAUSE, BACK and FORWARD. These are what control the 30 minute replay feature. The SKYFi2 constantly records the last 30 minutes of whatever you listened to, regardless of your changing the channel. One thing to note is that this 30 minute memory gets wiped out every time the unit is turned off. Pressing the BACK button will take you back one event (song change) at a time.</description>

No plans to buy one today, just looking.
The saying goes something like, ‚ÄúThe two happiest days in a boat owners life are The Day they bought it and the day the sold it.</description>

The Pullman area reminded me of¬†the farming community where I grew up, Estevan, Saskatchewan. Here‚Äôs a snapshot I took on the road home, just outside of Pullman.There is nothing quite as soothing as a warm summer night on the prairies, the smell of freshly harvested wheat and the open road.</description>

      <description>Greetings from Lewiston, Idaho (about 20 minutes southeast of Pullman, WA).¬†We spent the morning driving to Pullman and getting Brynn settled in at the university residence.
As I watched all the kids unload boxes with their parents it was definitely a who‚Äôs who of the electronics business.¬†Televisions, DVDs players, XBoxes and Playstation 2‚Äôs were in abundance.
Brynn lucked out and her dorm is wireless which is pretty cool.¬†We got a hotel down in Lewiston and it has free wi-fi throughout.</description>

It looks like XM Radio uses XML in their backend too.¬†Just the other day while listening to the 80‚Äôs channel I had quite the surprise when I looked at the head unit.</description>

It maintains some of the best features of the original MS-Paint application and includes new, powerful tools. Such new tools include a history storage for undos and redos, and powerful multi-layering which is often seen only in high-quality, expensive photo-applications.</description>

I love these types of talks, makes me realize how lucky I‚Äôve been in my life and how there‚Äôs no excuses to push hard and dream big.
A friend of mine, originally from my home province of Saskatchewan does a similar talk that Mike does, his name is Alvin Law.</description>

The Five-Minute Rule:
‚ÄúIf software breaks within the first 5 minutes of install or usage, TOSS IT.‚Äù
The One-Day Rule:
‚ÄúUse a new piece of software for a day. When I wake up in the morning, if I am not moved to continue using it, or if I am having difficulty using or configuring it, uninstall it.</description>

      <description>Tonight Scoble mentioned, my seven day rule for evaluating software and I figured I‚Äôd explain a bit more about my short attention span for new applications.¬†I love to try out new software all the time, in fact its sort of an obsession.¬†I‚Äôm always on the prowl for cool new applications.¬†After seven days of use though if I‚Äôm not totally blowon away or if its not improving my PC life, its straight to add/remove programs I go.</description>

Tomorrow the scaffolding arrives and Jodi says she‚Äôs going to be¬†spending a lot of time here once it arrives.¬†We‚Äôll see a lot more progress then.¬†Of course as the old cliche goes a picture is worth a thousand words, so I‚Äôve uploaded some photos highlighting the progress to date.</description>

      <description>I was surfing around this morning reading Weblog‚Äôs to see who‚Äôs coming to the PDC and was confused by this trackback link¬†on my post encouraging variations on the PDC 2003 sticker.¬†What the heck does Stuart mean by ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre in the bushes‚Äù¬† ?
Shrugging it off and wondering what inside joke I was missing I did a Feedster.com¬†search for PDC 2003 and while checking out the links I found out what was going on.</description>

      <description>So I woke up this morning to the surprise of many of you picking up the PDC flair.¬†Most likely due to a little Google juice supplied by Mr. Scoble¬†and the aggregation of the homepage on http://weblogs.asp.net
Check out these variations:¬†¬†¬†
Well the third one I could do without :-), but that is reality.¬†Thank you so much to all of you who are planning to attend the PDC.</description>

      <description>A little Weblog flair for PDC 2003 Attendees.¬†Feel free to repurpose on your Weblog if you are coming to the PDC.

Maybe, I should update my Blogroll for people coming to the PDC.¬†The list to the right looks accurate, I wonder if Dave is going to come?</description>

      <description>Yes!¬†Dave announced today that Jake has released trackback¬†for Radio.¬†Very cool, let‚Äôs see if this works.¬†I wonder if Dave‚Äôs visit to California helped get this implemented or if it was just a coincidence.¬†Time watch and see who implements it on their Weblogs.</description>

      <description>Recipe Time!
My mom tuned me into this recipe last time she was down visiting and I had to share.¬†Sorry, but I¬†don‚Äôt know who to credit this recipe to, but it is quick, fun and tastey.¬†I did some Google Recipe hunting this morning and found the precise ingredients, even better they had the key ingredient at Safeway.¬†Let me know if you try it.

      <description>I love my Toshiba Portege 3500 Tablet PC.¬†It is beefy enough to run Visual Studio, has a decent battery life and a good size screen.¬†In my office though I still use a desktop PC for my day to day work.¬†I wanted a way to use the tablet also for running my news aggregator , viewing my schedule, while still using my monitor for my main PC.¬†Here is what I did:</description>

      <description>I have for the past few months been enjoying my subscription to PressPlay.¬†I take great interest in today‚Äôs news that Roxio has acquired PressPlay.¬†It will be fun watching Roxio relaunch the¬†Napster service.
My family is hooked on PressPlay.¬†I have a PC configured with PressPlay connected to our Bose home theater.¬†We use Windows XP‚Äôs Remote Desktop feature to control the PressPlay PC from a laptop via my home 802.</description>

      <description>I love how my plants are turning out this year.¬†One of the nice things about Seattle‚Äôs winter of rain and gloom is that you appreciate the summer weather.¬†I need to work on my plant selection though, when I picked the plants for my landscaping I didn‚Äôt get enough variety.¬†Once my Rhododenreons¬†loose their flowers my backyard loses some of its shine.So can
someone recommend plantings that will get me blooms from now until September?</description>

      <description>After many failed attempts at writing a web log¬†and finally being encouraged by two co-workers to pick up the proverbial pen I‚Äôm at it once again.¬†I‚Äôve played with a number of the web-logging clients this last year.¬†I‚Äôve used Blogger.com¬†for my family photo gallery, BlogX¬†for an Internal weblog, Erablog to test the new Windows Media Plug-in and now Radio¬†for this weblog.¬†Radio has it quirks (doesn‚Äôt all software :-)), but I decided to shell out $39.</description>
