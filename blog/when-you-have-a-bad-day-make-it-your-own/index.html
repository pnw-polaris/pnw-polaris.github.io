    <p>For the last 20 years July 27th has been a very sad day.¬† You see July 27th is the anniversary of when my only brother died.¬†¬† Rod was 21 years old and was killed in a head on collision while driving home to Estevan, Saskatchewan fro Regina.¬† This year marks the 20th anniversary.</p>
<p>It happened during a really bad rainstorm when a truck hydroplaned, lost control and drove head on into his car. Rod died instantly.¬† Man, his wedding day was only a month away.¬† He left behind a fiancee, countless friends, a little brother and a Mom and Dad.¬† He had just completed Electronics Engineering and had a whole life ahead of him.</p>
<p>My brother and I shared one passion and a dream‚Ä¶.¬† That dream was to own a Corvette.</p>
<p>Ever since Rod and I were the yougest of age we talked about Corvettes, drew pictures of Corvettes, built Lego Corvettes, bought plastic models of Corvettes and imagined our bicycles were Corvettes.¬† We‚Äôd beg Dad to take us down to the Chevrolet dealership when the new models came in and just look at them, returning home with a brochure as a treasure.¬† Never actually thinking we‚Äôd ever own one.</p>
<p>20 years ago on July 27th, a police officer pulled up to our home in Estevan to inform us that Rod had died in a car accident.¬† I remember seeing my mom and dad almost collapse at the news, what a blow.¬† Shock, disbelief not sure what else to say.¬† I can remember the numbness, like someone kicking you right in the stomach.¬†¬† I‚Äôll always remember the funeral people from around the country and that Rod‚Äôs gravestone has a Corvette emblem on it.¬† The emblem served as a reminder for something he did not have time with us to purchase.</p>
<p>So July 27th has always been a bad day.</p>
<p>Each year as it comes around my family is sad, we remember how hard it was to push through emotions, the tears, the sadness and the funeral.¬† My family puts a tribute in the classifieds of the local paper to also mark the day.</p>
<p>So I decided this year to take July 27th back for me.¬† No more sadness, no more tears, let‚Äôs get a great memory to happen on this day.</p>
<p>Yesterday I found <a class="link" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffsand/sets/72157594215069270/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >a Corvette</a>, my first one and bought it.¬† It is like new, is in impeccable condition with only 12,000 miles and is a dream come true.</p>
<p><a class="link" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffsand/sets/72157594215069270/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    ><img class="reflect" style="width: 500px; height: 375px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/62/200385293_7eeb98738f.jpg?v=0" border="1" alt="Corvette" hspace="0" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>So when I had locked on a price and the deal was final, I called Dad and told him what I bought.¬† We were both so excited, running through features, model and year.¬† I then said, ‚ÄúDad, Rod would be proud.‚Äù¬† silence came over the phone‚Ä¶ We both broke down over the phone in tears and choked up, we both could not talk.</p>
<p>I then returned to the sales office where my wife was to finish the deal and replayed the story back for her and the sales manager.¬† We all actually teared up a bit again.</p>
<p>So I drove home a happy person and now have a new memory for July 27th.¬† A very good one.</p>
<p>Enjoy life, hug your family and go after your dreams‚Ä¶</p>
<p>When you have anniversaries for moments that are sad, take them back and make them good ones‚Ä¶</p>
<p>We‚Äôre only here for a short time‚Ä¶</p>
<p>¬†</p>
