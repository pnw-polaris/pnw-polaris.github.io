Not today.</p> <p align=left>Today, I am returning from Orlando and making my way up to Minot, North Dakota.&nbsp; My parents live in Estevan, Saskatchewan which is about two hours north of that.&nbsp; The Canadian Sandquists are having a family reunion tonight with folks coming from all around the country.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been pretty excited about it, but hadn&#8217;t had much time to think about it all as I&#8217;ve been heads down preparing for [MGX][1] and the [10 1.0 Ship][2].&nbsp; So needless to say once I had MGX behind me and I started to think about the prospects of seeing folks I haven&#8217;t seen for years tonight, I got really excited.</p> <p align=left>This morning I got on the plane in Orlando that was going to get me to Minneapolis.&nbsp; From there I take short flight off to Minot, North Dakota where my Dad would pick me up to drive the rest of the way to Estevan.&nbsp; Estevan is a small town of about 10,000 people and the airport doesn&#8217;t have commercial flights.</p> <p align=left>So I&#8217;m on board the flight and the captain comes over the speaker to say that we&#8217;d be delayed for about 10 minutes.&nbsp; I figure no sweat, I&#8217;ve got an hour and half stop in Minneapolis, I&#8217;m fine.&nbsp; The pilot comes on again to say maybe 10 minutes longer.&nbsp; I&#8217;m a little nervous now as I know the flight schedules off by heart to Minot from Minneapolis.&nbsp; There&#8217;s an early morning flight, one in the afternoon (the one I am scheduled for) and a 10:30 pm flight.&nbsp; I figure I should mention this to one of the flight attendants so I can see how long they are really thinking it will take.</p> <p align=left>One thing that drives me insane is when people are rude to the flight attendants when there are delays.&nbsp; I&#8217;m pretty sure its not their fault and when there are mechanical problems they aren&#8217;t in control of the mechanics.&nbsp; Heck, that is what unions are for. :->&nbsp; So when I talk to the attendant and explain that I really need to get on the afternoon flight Minot out of Minneapolis as I have family reunion it bothers me a bit when she rudely tells me to &#8220;call the 1-800&#8221; number and walks away.&nbsp; </p> <p align=left>The rancher from North Dakota sitting next me jokes, &#8220;Hey I thought they only did that when you were an ass to them&#8221;. I waited a bit longer as the captain came over the speaker to say just 10 more minutes.&nbsp; I decided to stand up to make my call to the 1-800 and stretch my legs at the same time.&nbsp; I notice that most of the first class cabin was cleared out and they no have the door open to the gate.</p> <p align=left>I find out they sent a number of folks on First Class to another gate to Minneapolis.&nbsp; I grab my bags to see if I can get on that plane (my wife calls me a luckbox as things usually work out my way), but not today.&nbsp; Its full.&nbsp; (with the first class passengers from my original flight).&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no way I am going to make my afternoon flight to Minot.&nbsp; The Northwest attendant books me onto the 10:30 pm flight to Minot, I call my folks to give them the bad news.&nbsp; Their bummed, a few of my cousins fly out in the morning, so I won&#8217;t see them.&nbsp; The attendant apologizes again and says, &#8220;Man.&nbsp; We screwed up&#8221;.&nbsp; She also could not print me a boarding pass as there was more than 6 hours until my flight out of Minneapolis.&nbsp; </p> <p align=left>I get into Minneapolis and try and get a boarding pass for my flight to Minot and the attendant at the desk couldn&#8217;t find me one.&nbsp; He finally grumbles, &#8220;Look can you just go the main ticketing desk in the main terminal?&nbsp; You have plenty of time!&#8221;&nbsp; I decide to go for walk and find the supervisor to respectfully vent about my day and see if I can get a boarding pass from him without having to make the trek in and out of security.</p> 
<p>After about 30 minutes, I finally tracked down a supervisor and had a great discussion about the day.¬† He was apologetic and said , ‚ÄúSir, since we declared bankruptcy the flight attendance and staff really just don‚Äôt care for the passengers anymore.¬† I know they should, but they don‚Äôt‚Äù.¬† He did bump me up to first class, apologized profusely and I made my way to find a wifi connection where I could plug-in and charge my laptop.¬† I tried to see if I could get a first class lounge pass and he said we only do that for international delays.¬†¬†</p>
<p>It is kind of poetic justice I guess that <a class="link" href="http://channel9.msdn.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >Channel 9</a>, is <a class="link" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/channel9"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >modelled after the transparency</a> found by United Airlines.¬†¬† Today my experience by Northwest was not transparent.¬† If they had been transparent I could have gotten on a different airline and made my way to the family reunion.¬† So that‚Äôs been my day.¬† It is not the end of the world, I think a few of the folks who are attending the reunion will be going for brunch tomorrow and I‚Äôll have less of a hangover tomorrow too. <p align=left>I did make one amazing discovery at the Minneapolis Airport.¬† I found a</p>
<p><em>sweet</em> location to plug-in your laptop and get on the airport.¬† The TGI Fridays in terminal C has a long table of stools with <em>ample</em> plug ins.¬†¬† The food is ok and I can relax here for the next¬†4 hours while I wait for my flight.¬† </p></p>
<p>It is always hard to find a good power source at airports, so while sitting here I started up a Wiki to <a class="link" href="http://www.jeffsandquist.com/FindingPowerOutletsAtAirports.aspx"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >begin tracking power sources and Wi-Fi locations at airports</a> across the globe.¬† (I‚Äôll fine tune it a bit more later).¬† Hopefully this can become something as cool as my <a class="link" href="http://wiki.jeffsandquist.com/default.aspx/GTD/GTDTools.html"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >Getting Things Done Toolkit Wiki</a>.</p>
<p>More later‚Ä¶¬†¬† Off to eat a ‚Äústeak‚Äù at TGI Fridays with a plastic knife.</p>
